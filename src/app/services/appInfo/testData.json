        "Errors abound. Much like their planes. This app has crashed or given errors when I pull it up to get my boarding pass many, many times. Sometimes at TSA, sometimes when boarding. I have held up lines, and nearly missed flights because the Delta app, like everything else about the airline, is poorly maintained and almost designed to frustrate you. They need to do better.",
        "Getting a mobile boarding pass with Delta is like getting a root canal. Had to check in 10 times to finally get something usable. The mobile site to app integration is non-existent and at one point the app asked me to use a different desktop browser. Wow. I'm on Android using a Pixel 6. Had to create logins just to avoid printing paper at the airport.",
        "Unable to book any flights in the app due to some unknown error, App is showing incorrect information for flights booked on the website, app repeatedly prompts me to check in for my flight even though i've checked in multiple times already and have my boarding pass, which shows for a half second and then vanishes. You cannot rely on this to get you through the airport and thus it is totally worthless. This app might as well not exist, it only causes problems.",
        "When it works it's fantastic. But it has \"technical difficulties\" essentially every time I fly, so I'm forced to uninstall and reinstall. As you might imagine that's the worst time to have to do that. This app is so unreliable I take screenshots whenever it opens since I expect it to fail the next time.",
        "This app is the worst! I always have to uninstall and reinstall in order to get it to work. Not even a clear cache and forced stop helps to fix it! Which makes it very inconvenient when you want to use the app to check in or for your boarding pass at the airport. Good thing I always print my pass as back up."

        "Works wonderfully. I setup my ds video station though, correctly configured the settings, mapped out where my videos were, customized permissions, and after that, this works wonderfully. Think \"Netflix\" except you run it. For videos I have the ds video load and play videos through my player pro, but you can also use vlc media player too. Else your at the mercy of the synology Nas and its encoding on the fly processing power.",
        "After 3 years, this is still worthless garbage. It plays fro 2 seconds, stalls for 2 seconds. Couldn't be more frustrating. All other apps work fine. 100mb NAS connection and 4G T-mobile tests at 90mb sec. So it's not the network. No setting changes anything. SYNOLOGY - FIX THIS - you can't blame thousands of users.",
        "The Android and Android TV app flat out don't work. \"Unknown error\". I'm streaming my media using a DS920+, latest os. Trying to stream to Galaxy Note 20 Ultra on Android 11 with April security and Shield TV version 8.2.2. Streaming works on my 2020 Samsung TV and via the web. Very disappointed. [UPDATE] My Shield TV seems to magically start working today. No upgrades. My phone, now updated to the latest May security update, still will not play movies.",
        "It works but needs a update badly. Need to be cache videos thumbnails, every time I open the app it loads the thumbnails. Better video streaming. The app keeps logging me out while watching videos. The app hasn't been updated in years. Synology is a big company they should stay on top of their apps.",
        "The app works well and does what it needs. But I'm removing 2 stars for the subpar user experience and lack of convenience features: all episodes have to be downloaded one by one, no possibility of selecting seasons, shows or multiple episodes at once. Also, you have to dig into an episode/movie to download it, you can't do it from the overview page. And in the downloaded videos tab, all videos are listed without grouping them per show or anything."

        "Truly a terrible experience. On the off chance it works, it's good enough - but it works so rarely that I regret buying the entire system. For one of many errors, if you assign a device to a profile and leave it offline for too long (or forget to delete it when you get rid of it), it will crash the app anytime you try to do anything with it. It will never drop off, so you have to call the company and spend 30 minutes trying to get it removed.",
        "The app is simple to use and to understand. When first setting up the eeros devices, it's pretty straightforward, just a matter of not rushing to set up the devices. You can controll certain aspects of the Wifi, from limiting the amount of devices connected to your home network and creating profiles catered to individuals, (their devices) connected to your network and a few other things too.",
        "Never had issues with my system. Never had bad experience from tech support. Never once thought \"maybe I should go back to something different\". I'm seeing a lot of reviews that are saying how bad this app / system is. I disagree with all of the ones I've seen. Most of them are feature requests (they will be added eventually), \"bugs\" (which I either never experienced/something VERY rare), or how bad Secure+ is (I find it VERY useful and worth it... you get 3 other FREE subscriptions with it..).",
        "The app is easy to use and straight forward, providing all standard features that the bulk of users would need. The Eero 6 Pro (2 nodes) that I'm using was also easy to setup and has been stable, running several months with no need to touch settings. I would like a browser interface made available for when I need it; but otherwise, no issues for me. I would caution power users to look elsewhere, as the app lacks some features that group of users may want.",
        "Lots of systems will not connect. Examples: had issues with initial convection to ring. Had to use a different router. Had issue with Google pixel 6 phone. Had to use a different router. There have been other issues as well. Also, for the cost, I'd expect repeater capability. If that is possible, it does not appear as an option."

        "It's pretty, but useless. The standard Android signal indicator can provide as much useful information out of the box. With 1meter resolution, it's a field strength meter of limited uitility as an indoor heatmap unless you are using it in a extraordindarily large home or a commercial building. I saw no obvious way to link a floorplan, no setting or controls with which to do it, no way to toggle between indoors and outdoors. It showed the IP address of my router as 0.0.0.0 :-C",
        "Mapping and measuring kept not recording. A better drawing tools might have made the drawing better. Needs to be able to set distance while drawing or you will most likely have a bad map, unless you are good at drawing maps without a ruler or other measurement/accuracy tool. Couldn't even complete my bad map drawing though because it wouldn't record any new measurements after the first.",
        "Do not even attempt to use the drawing feature to create your floorplan. It is by far the single worst drawing app I have ever used in my 30+ years on this planet. The only saving grace is that there's a free-draw tool, but even that is restricted by the inability to zoom or pan. Draw your floor plan in literally any other tool, even MSPaint is better, and import it instead. Hell, even Corel Draw from the early 90s is a better tool.",
        "Well built app. The UI is impressive and responsive. I purchased the 28.99 Premium and I am happy.",
        "The concept is good the execution is kinda horrible.. UI and functionality would be forgiven if there was automation. At the moment the user has to do everything manually and that's the experience is crushing at best. If the devs manage to insert automation such as automatic in doors triangulation running on the background then maybe it has a chance.."

        "Latest fix actually made the problems with the android watch list widget even worse. Now not only does it go to black screen when you press on an individual stock on the watch list, the refresh button in the top right hand corner doesn't refresh the widget. Guys seriously. Just do away with the widget and put it out of its misery. And why are the futures so hard to find!!!! They should be the first things you see on the screen. Those and any news related to the stocks in your portfolio. 🤦‍♀️",
        "So far it seems user-friendly, Easy to understand. There is a so much data and so many choices that it makes investing satisfying and easy. I'm up over 100% returns on my Roth IRA because of the wealth of information provided by fidelity. It really helped me understand how everything works together. The new view is awful and I hate it. All the goodies and different choices are hidden or obscured/removed. I hope to God they never get rid of classic view.",
        "Newly designed app looks much better, increasing the overall rating for the new design, but still many issues, the positions page does not work properly, cannot scroll down or left/right properly, been happening for a couple weeks now, I see other reviews mention this issue as well. Not very intuitive, actually annoying, to have to click the \"Login\" button each time you open the app vs the login page/biometrics ready to take input, also same for clicking on \"Tap to view balances\" for overview.",
        "1) The app often freezes and then logs me out. 2) It takes way too long for the app to load. Needs to be much snappier. 3) Often when I exit the app (without logging out) and return, it makes me sign in again, even before the 30-minute time out (and even seconds after being on the app). 4) When the setting is set to \"streaming\" the prices, it's extremely laggy and difficult to scroll around. Not intuitive at all.",
        "Updated 5/25/22 - I want to like this app but it's trying. I don't like the fact I have to click \"login\" after opening the app or tap to \"quick view\" when I've already enabled. That should be assumed. Removed another ⭐. Complicated app. The overall process of making changes in the app is confusing. Face unlock is a welcome change."

        "I used to love Docs, but the last update ruined it. I am notorious for having documents upwards of 40+ thousand words and to have the pop up that it can't detect my errors after 4,000 words when using mobile is ridiculous. I don't care if it can't detect them, but I make MORE errors because I can't see through the message that I don't even have an option to turn off. Very frustrating.",
        "You are unable to access the top-down menu bar without scrolling upwards. So, if I want to place a picture in a specific spot, I have to scroll away from that spot before I can use the menu needed to place the picture. This is a totally rookie oversight that makes me feel like the makers of the app don't even use the app. If the option is in there to make the menu come down without scrolling, then you, as developers, NEED to display that option because IT IS NOT IN THE SETTINGS OR TUTORIALS!",
        "The \"document is too long to detect grammar issues\" pop up is popping up on documents less than 4000 words and makes the app absolutely useless. It pops up every time you type a word and makes it impossible to see what you are typing and kills your devices battery on top of it. I'm not sure why this is suddenly an issue when I have 20,000 word documents that worked perfectly two months ago. Absolutely infuriating.",
        "If I could give this a negative rating, I would. I can't write with this app at all now because the pop up (telling me that it can't detect grammar issues because the text is too long) stays up over the words I'm typing. The document is only 4000 words, and there are no grammatical errors to detect. This last update was terrible, and the issue has only gotten worse. The pop up used to only appear at the beginning of opening the doc. Now it's with every single letter. Do better.",
        "I love Google Docs. However, I give it 4 out of 5 stars because of an issue I am experiencing. When I try to print a google doc from my chromebook, the app freezes. In order to unfreeze the app, I have to shut down and restart my chromebook. 3/26/22 Update: With the latest update to my chromebook, the issue seems to have resolved itself. Hopefully it will continue to work!"

        "Gotta say, I absolutely love the feature that allows you to pin your mobile boarding pass to your homescreen! I'm leaving a review just because this is such an awesome and helpful feature! You just tap the hovering pin, and it pulls up your boarding pass instantly. So much easier than trying to juggle with an app to load your boarding pass.",
        "Best airline app as compared to other airline. You can see the effort put into it. I can change seats, change flights, etc. better than other apps. The only issue I have is that it regularly requests my payment information for \"contactless payment\". If an airline is going to 100% contactless, then the system needs to 100% support it without continuously asking for payment information.",
        "Had to rescan documents multiple times. Had trouble getting boarding passes. Had to text through the app for an hour before they would rectify problems with my boarding pass. They just told me to check in through the terminal at the airport. They only helped me after I demanded a boarding pass that day. It is impossible to tell how long the chat queue is. They did eventually get my boarding pass to show up on the app, but they provided no way for me to print it off earlier.",
        "I had booked a flight. it did not show up on my united app, so I thought it didn't go through so I booked my flight again. it was a fiasco booking this flight as it kept looping back to finish booking. I ended up with 4 bookings. I was able to cancel them, but I'm still being charged for two flights. now I added a checked bag, which was supposed to be cheaper if I did so prior to arriving at the airport. no deal. I'm supposed to get free checked bags with my credit card. not happening.",
        "This app is very slow with updating status, which can cause you to go to the wrong gate if you don't double-check the monitors or with agents. International check-in and pre-flight documentation entry features are horrible. It is very non-intuitive to find information about your specific flight, like types of meals, chargers, etc. If you have a connection, it's cumbersome to get to second the boarding pass, even after the first flight has concluded."

        "I've had Shazam for about 5 years. Each phone I get (which isn't many) I instantly download this app and put a widget of it on my home screen. Never had any issues. I love that it has the option for most songs to view the lyrics. It gives details on the artist and the option to go back to the list of songs you \"shazamed\". One of my favorite tools on my phone! You may get a \"No result\" but it's not often.",
        "I love this app. My personal music library has grown exponentially because even if I hear an ad or commercial on social media..I can capture it and save it. I just need to figure out how I can keep it on the screen at all times if needed. I've been able to overlap it onto other apps, but if i have to remove it i have a hard time getting it to overlay.",
        "An older versions of the app, Shazam used to automatically add songs to a Spotify playlist. This made it very easy to use, as then I could quickly reorganize within Spotify as needed. However, now it seems like that functionality's been removed from the app?? Similarly, when the app finds a match, it used to show the button to quickly open in Spotify or add to playlist in Spotify. Now it seems like the only button that's available is open in Apple Music, and there's no way to change it?? 😡",
        "I love that I am *mostly* able to identify songs and save them on a Spotify Playlist. Widget option is choice (EASY TO ACCESS) while driving & saving songs. It's so fun to play the Playlist of Shazamed songs and get a great shuffle variety of all the different things that have caught my ear over the year. I often find myself in a 50/50 split between shazaming songs I'm familiar with just to add them to that Playlist and discovering new songs at live events/on radio while driving.",
        "When the name of that song or the artist is right on the tip of your tongue, but just won't fully manifest and you know it will be bothering you all night, Shazam keeps us sane. 😂 This was one of the first apps I ever downloaded, and I've added it to every phones since. It's also perfect for when you hear an old song and there's one line in it that you always wondered what they were saying, as Shazam supplies lyrics for most songs, as well as information on the song, artist and album, and more."

        "Great for searching rental listings. Doesn't have the messaging feature though, so I need to have both the app and the website open at the same time, defeating the purpose of having an app on the first place. Also, when you use the app to request a tour, the message sent doesn't actually ask for a tour. Also would be better if there was a way to hide listings you don't want too see anymore, and a different color or shape to denote listings you have already applied for.",
        "This app is pretty spot on. It let's you filter and save your searches to weed out any properties that don't fit your criteria. Whether, it's in a location that you're not interested in moving to or if you want a pool, big yard, fireplace, etc. It notifies you if the status of your saved properties has changed, it also let's you know if something new that matches your saved search turns up. If you get tired of the daily notifications you can just shut them off through the app settings. 👍",
        "Love this app...makes looking easier and can usually see them even before our agent. Only hit is that I wish I could eliminate ones I was not interested in so they didn't show at all or the dot could be marked black or something. Having viewed ones turn pale is great, but find myself rechecking the same ones over and over that I do not want. Also, would be great if you could eliminate a property feature or area (i.e all houses WITHOUT a pool, or whole state except this county).",
        "Not sure what happened but maybe was after a recent update but I no longer am able to see lot lines when I view the map of a property.

I love the idea of this app and would love to be able to earn more money to donate to these causes, please fix these issues!",
        "Samsung! Please fix this app! I've tried deleting re-downloading four times. It still doesn't work properly! I would have rated this app 5 stars in the first few months I was using it. An awesome option for in-between moments instead of wasting time on other apps. On this one, you can actually donate to send amazing causes. But in the last couple weeks it's not giving me money for watching ads and videos. And when I did get money, there's an error message when I try to donate.",
        "It worked pretty well at first. Unfortunately with most phones you can't just keep it up all night as it charges, because the screen will shut off after a certain time so it became a bit discouraging to have to keep monitoring my phone anyway. As of about a month ago I stopped getting ads all together (so I have earned nothing) I love the concept and would love to continue, but I would also like to see some of these things fixed Maybe a setting that will override the phones \"auto-shutoff\" ?",
        "This app was amazing a few months ago. I used to be able to just sit and click on as many ads as I had time and then when I went into my phone and it didn't take long for me to get a dollar or two and donate. It was even better when you guys started matching the donation. Then something happened where no matter how many ads I clicked on I rarely earned anything more than a cent or two for clicking ads, unlocking the lockscreen, and then charging it. It's been months and I have only 11 cents!",
        "I love the concept and I think its amazing that Samsung is matching all donations but the app does not function properly for me and after reading a lot of these reviews it seems that others are having the same issue. Initially it worked great but after earning a little over $1 I stopped earning money from the ads and then they just stopped showing up all together! I've also never earned money while charging even though I have it enabled. This ap has so much potential if they can fix these bugs!"

        "It's ok... Gotta be honest though. The inability to zoom in and out on my spread sheets makes using the app cumbersome. I will be switching to just using the Web Browser version where I have no issues with this. Adding this \"feature\" would greatly improve my experience with it. Not sure why it's not in here as that hasnt been a missing \"feature\" of spread sheet programs since the 90's haha.",
        "The android/chromebook app is missing the PC menu. Without this menu nearly ALL options are difficult to find, and some are outright impossible! For example, there is no way to set a custom date format (I prefer mm/dd/yy for all dates, and leading zeros are an absolute requirement!). Support is impossible to access, and the Help is less than useful.",
        "Basic functions are not (easily) available. Not sure if I am just completely overlooking it but I cannot find the number formatting option anywhere. I have looked it up on google and the location google says it is, I have checked, and it is not there. Also, you cannot easily switch between tabs, you have to check the blue check at the top before switching between tabs in one sheet. Another issue is that I cannot open the same sheet in two separate windows. Please advise!",
        "Works ok when it works. Most of the time I when I open it for some reason it switches me to view only mode but only on one of my documents. I have access on my laptop but not phone. I have to uninstall and reinstall app to make it work. Does for a time or two then back to view only mode. Yes I'm logged into the right account and no...no one has changed permissions. Very frustrating",
        "Unlike the mobile app version of Google Docs, I find the mobile version of Google Sheets annoying to scroll through just to get where I want to edit something (if it would let me without messing something up), and the last time I used it there weren't many options available for customization or making things easier. Unless you feel like you really need it for whatever reason, I advise sticking with the browser version."

        "I hate the new Click To Reveal PIN feature. Huge time waste, terribly inconvenient. Google Authenticator was simple and easy to use before, and it was perfect the way it was. We could just open it up, scroll to the right entry, make sure the timer isn't about to run out, and get the code you need. \"Click to reveal PIN\" is just extra steps that do nothing but waste time and take extra taps. Please give us an option to disable the \"Click to reveal PIN\"",
        "Have used this for quite a bit for a few different things, latest update with the \"click to reveal pin\" my first thought was wow, that's super annoying. Went to the settings to see if you can turn that off and didn't find an option. Luckily I've been moving my totp to a self hosted bitwarden install and will only have this as a 2fa check to get into that password manager.",
        "works fine, does what it's supposed to. however, the recent update where it hides codes untill you tap them is SUPER ----ing annoying, and there is no setting to disable it. i know how to use my phone & not let other people see the screen, i dont need google to hold my hand. the settings menu is laughably empty, so you have plenty of space to add an option for this, google. \"if it's not broken, dont fix it. if you do, at least add a switch\"",
        "Click to reveal? Why? I guess this was given to an intern. It is not an improvement, there's no setting to disable it, the styling/margin of the message is awful, and the message itself is incorrect. It actually makes this look like a hacked app that someone with poor language skills changed.",
        "**SLOW AND UNRESPONSIVE** Opening the app takes 30-60 seconds now since the update. The new update broke my authenticator. It is slow to open and now forcing me to click on my codes to reveal them. This is horrible and should be an option. Change it back! Provide us an option whether we want this new feature. Most importantly, WE NEED SEARCH! Great Authenticator but as I am using it more, I have a long list of codes. It would be great to have search and ability to favorite specific ones."

        "I have used this app for years on multiple devices and have loved it. Over the last two weeks or so it's been having a lot of issues. It will give me a notification saying \"messages is processing an incoming message\" and either there will be a random image loading that was not actually sent to me, or it will not show any of my messages at all. I have to completely turn my phone off and back on to get my messages to show, or the loading image that isnt actually there to go away.",
        "Current update (5/16) is still broken. I don't think it's the app. I think something in the core OS is broken in some way as it affects notifications from other apps as well. I noticed the correlation over the last couple days when I figured out if I do a quick WiFi on and off it will start sending and receiving messages again. When doing this I noticed if it had been a while since messages had been working that I would also get a flood of app notifications unrelated to messages altogether.",
        "This app was really amazing until recently. When I send a text it won't send until a couple of minutes after. When sending it would completely disappear and sometimes not send at all. I've tried to do the touble shooting and update the app but it still didn't work out. I've tried to work with it for just a little bit more but it's failed completely, it won't even load up sometimes, I'm done with it.",
        "I love this app but since the update I've had nothing but issues. When I hit send I get an error message that there's an issue and the message can't be sent. Sometimes a message will act like its sending and then just disappears. Sometimes it will show back up 10 minutes later as sent but sometimes its just gone forever. I'm also not receiving messages. If someone sends multiple texts I will only get one and the other comes an hour later. Please fix this!!!!",
        "Started happening this past week or so. App is nearly unusable. Every time I enter a message. It disappears. Like it's put in a queue to send but it's not displayed on the messages lists. So I can't tell if it actually got sent. Sometimes it's take a VERY long time. Currently waiting over 10 min and don't know where my messages went. I would write it again but I know it would be a dupe and the same issue. Just seems like a bug that needs to be fixed."

        "mostly great. love that I can access it on my mobile device pretty much anywhere. However, it has an issue with casting to a television. In order for it to restart you have to stop casting and go through ANOTHER set of ads. It doesn't start where you leave off when it freezes. Other than that, happy with the app. Sad that the variety of shows is dwindling.",
        "I love Hulu, been a subscriber for many years. the only issue that I have, which is fairly recent is I just purchased a new Samsung galaxy tablet and there is no way to enlarge the picture on non-hd shows to fill the screen. please fix this with a software update. I also noticed that the listings of episodes in a series do not load on the latest version of the Hulu Android app. Like the issue of not being able to fill the screen, a software update could probably fix that.",
        "Streaming isn't consistent. It's not bad, maybe 20 seconds downtime if I just let a whole episode play. Skipping ahead while rewatching a show is almost impossible, the entire app freeze's. It's not my phone, it's a brand new model and I have 5G unlimited data. Never have this issue with Netflix or any of my other streaming apps. I'll give it a few months and see if it gets better. There's more content I'm interested in on Hulu than all of my other streaming apps combined so that's a plus.",
        "The \"my stuff\" tab hasn't worked properly on like three months now. I have to scroll or search for all my shows. It loads the show thumbnail but when you click it none of the episodes will load. The shows all work fine from the search bar or main page though. Don't know why I'm having to come out after, again, over three months of it being broken. Do you guys have any kind of quality control, or are you just trying to pull a Netflix?",
        "Hands-down, Hulu *still* has the worst UI in streaming. Want to skip to the next episode? There's a gigantic button right underneath the playback slider. Super convenient - I'm sure this button is far more in-demand than the 10-second skip buttons, which are super tiny and compressed into a tiny area. Be prepared to rewatch the same ads, repeatedly, because the app that *still* can't properly remember your place - a problem they've had for *years* - unless you pay extra."

        "It's nice the syncing makes it easy to seamlessly transition from mobile to pc. I do wish however that the attenuation feature worked a little better because no matter how many times I try it refuses to attenuate. It should also have integration with Nvidia Broadcast without having too much of an issue. Other than that great app and look forward to the future updates.",
        "The app is great, and I use it daily to catch up with friends. Since the last update however, I have been having issues where the app just won't open on my phone or just immediately crashes upon opening it. The only thing I really wish the app had that it doesn't is the ability to toggle the mute on channels off and on from the notifications center on my samsung.",
        "This would ve a five star, but there is a bug that simply won't stop bothering me! I use an Android version 9, and whenever I try to send images from my gallery, the thumbnails of half my gallery are different from the actual images, so I have to click on them to see what they actually are. The thumbnails are images from wayyy before, like an old picture of my cats from 2 months ago replacing the thumbnail of a downloaded image from today! Please tell me if this can be fixed, or on my end.",
        "Amazing app! As long as you have good connection and a good mic, the calls are good. Chatting is pretty nice and joining servers is easy. One small problem, the app won't open, so I have to reinstall it, but other than that, it's amazing and I 100% recommend it to people who have no friends, or are looking for more friends, because it's also a great place to make friends, just be careful of the people you reveal personal info to.",
        "I use this app daily because I have a lot of online friends, and for the most part it works great. My gripes all stem from voice chat. Whenever someone streams, the sound is terrible; it regularly cuts out and I can rarely hear any music in whatever they're streaming. Also, if I'm in a call, I cannot listen to anything else, because all audio is treated as if it's call audio and the quality drops dramatically. I don't know if this is a function of my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note9) or just the app."

        "Works flawlessly except for places like Amazon video where, due to content protection, I can't watch anything (Netflix SD plan works though?). I have been using this with 2 different Motorola phones for a few years now, and it works great, especially with my new phone. I haven't had a single issue with my new phone. It even works if you change the resolution of your phone with something like SecondScreen! This allows me to use any screen with any resolution.",
        "Works sometime. Mostly starts and dies. When it does work it works well, but usually stops after 10 or so minutes. Chokes on an Asus display port add-on monitor. Tries to start flashes on screen then fails. Set phone to always on and things have been running well. Changed rating to three, still some issues but this program is worth trying.",
        "With no option to auto connect, it is useless for certain use cases. I'm trying to use samsung dex on a Note 10 Plus and a Superbook. I can mirror the phone screen, but even with a hub and don't hdmi plug to activate dex, I cannot get dex through this. If I have an hdmi monitor I can, but that defeats the entire purpose of the Superbook, or having a portable displaylink to connect an Android device to a screen either with dex or if it's a device with no screen.",
        "I would like to take back part of my previous comment. I figured out that samsung uses dex. I accidentally click to switch to dex display when it prompted. Under notification panel, found out there is another prompt to switch to mirroring display which solves my problem. However, I would still like to have the capability to extend not mirror. But this is one step closer.",
        "I recently got hold of a small DisplayLink USB TFT screen that has been previously used with a cash register. Dunno the model, but it has a \"TVS\" logo on the front. Works flawless with Windows 10, but not with my tablet due to USB bus power issues. Not enough mAmps, I guess. I'm gonna try more Hosts at a later point of time. Maybe some of them have enough power to get the screen up and running. I'll keep you informed."

        "Clunky interface that's clearly trying to paper over back-end legacy systems that don't really talk to each other well. Does what you'd expect out of basic online banking, but often requires twice as many steps as it should, with counterintuitive navigation. Missing some incredibly basic functionality like searching past transactions instead of endless scrolling. Balance may be off for days after some transactions, not smart enough to deduct things that they haven't finished processing.",
        "Update: April 29th - Quick view FINALLY working. Before: Nothing listed under the Quick view header. April 21st and Quick view STILL not working. Seems like this has been going on for over a month now. Uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled. Did not work. All settings on. April 22, still not working. Quick view settings locked when trying to change accounts that show up when logged in to the app. Something is definitely wrong in the app itself and not going to be fixed by reinstalling the app.",
        "Regularly have to log out and restart the app because the back button doesn't work. When I contacted support to alert them of this problem (which it appears other people are having also) they said it is likely a problem with MY phone. No other apps have this problem. This response tells me they don't take my feedback seriously and have no intention of fixing it.",
        "App lets me into my account maybe 10% of the time. Mostly freezes at the login screen. Have forced it closed, restarted my phone, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no change in performance. It worked much better in the past, not very useful anymore. Do not recommend.",
        "This app is a pain. I had 4 checks to deposit. The app kept closing. Of course each time I had to sign in all over again. The camera feature is really touchy also. I spent almost an hour trying to deposit 3 checks. I had another check I needed to deposit but gave up in frustration! The app creator needs to fix the bugs in it. This procedure should have taken 10 minutes, tops. Instead J spent an hour due to the many crashes, having to sign in 6 or 7 times,and the fussy camera, and I'm not thru"

        "U2F is a great idea but needs to be implemented with some key things in mind. A person is the ultimate and only true trusted entity. Duo very poorly handles the eventuality of a phone breaking, being lost, new numbers. This can be partially avoided for 90% of cases if people always set up 2 devices at the same time, more the better. 3 devices would fix 95% of complaints problems. However there needs to be a way to transfer to another phone after-the-fact, the technology allows, not the app.",
        "We have been using it for a few years now and have experienced next to no issues. I administer it for our company and it works wonderfully online or offline. Switching to a new phone is easy by using the migrate function and if you get a new phone and forget that then have it call/text you instead. All the reviews about people being mad that they are forced to use it are dragging the scores down, overall it is a stable and capable app.",
        "Search/Sort Needed - In general the app works but could benefit from a sort and/or search feature. I currently have 36 accounted connected to Duo for 2FA. Trying to navigate through this list is tedious, especially since I can't put in custom account icons. Sorting alphabetically would be an improvement but the best option would be the ability to search by service, login, or both.",
        "Does not allow users to manually add codes, you have to use a qr code or select the service you need from a list. This would be fine if not for the fact that the reader app won't let you scan from files on the phone and the preset lists don't have what you need 99% of the time. Poorly thought out, use something else.",
        "I find the app works fine, and very pleased compared to another apps I had to use. It always works; cellular, wifi or the deep basements. As far as switching the buttons, they were naturally backward anyway. It took some getting used to but I did. Face it, everything changes. Guess some people never had a PC, never used email, still have their original cell phone. Change is inevitable, no one likes it but we deal."

        "Was great. But recent changes have really become annoying. The good night mode used to work when you fell asleep and turn off when you woke up. Reliably for me. Now, it's not even an option. Par for the course for Samsung. Edit: months in and the app is still missing features it had in the past. Usable and great features removed. They've made several updates since removing the auto detect night mode and it's apparently not coming back.",
        "The app itself us super easy to use. It randomly disconnects and reconnects my watch, sometimes 3-4 times a day. Also, every single time there's an update, which happens sort of frequently, it turns off the \"block touch\" option for my galaxy buds pro. I keep that on bc i move and sweat a lot at work, so i end up adjusting my buds routinely, only to find i have stopped or skipped or changed the volume of what I'm listening to. Very annoying",
        "Disconnects During Calls Not sure what's going on with the app or the ear buds. I love Samsung and would boast about them over the Apple products but now I feel a little irritated. Every couple of minutes during a phone call, it drops and disconnects. I would connect it back only for it to drop again. Now it won't connect at all... Totally frustrating!!!!",
        "App software use to be great. Since updated, I do not see any text notifications. It seems to pick and choose what notifications it will show on the watch face. I'm constantly missing calls because I get no notifications. I have to keep my phone silent due to the nature of my work, fix this issue Samsung.",
        "What happened?? This app used to be amazing and now I am just frustrated. I am, fortunately, not experiencing all the other issues that the others are (my watch is connecting to my phone) but since the last two updates my Galaxy watch will now notify me repeatedly, like I have 7 or 8 text messages coming in at once, that I have a voicemail. It does this off and on during my whole work day or until I check my voicemail. Has gotten so awful that I am missing in text messages that I need for work."

        "Discover feature is absolutely horrible, especially since it took away the ability to easily find our favorite subreddits. They keep changing things around that don't need to be changed, like the profile button just switched sides negating years of muscle memory. Also, the video player never works properly. It's completely random on if it will work or not. Super super frustrating. It's just a culmination of poor decisions at this point.",
        "Developers make it impossible to want to use this app. There is NO consistency with video playback. Sometimes when you're in a full screen video you've tapped into, back works fine to get back to the thread, and then again to go back to the main feed. Other times, back once goes to the top of the main feed completely. It's infuriating.",
        "It's very buggy, content is good but the bugs make it hard to navigate. I try to open a post and it resets to the first post in your feed, and duplicates posts and that are not the same post when I click them. (Update) it's gotten worse. When I try to open a post, it takes either a long time to open or just does not open. Also videos stop playing after a while and it slows down if opened for too long, even in the background.",
        "One terrible update after another that completely breaks the app. Issues with the video player still exist where videos will refuse to play and instead stay a static image. Attempting to open a post's comments results in a black screen that does nothing. App randomly lags out and crashes for no apparent reason. Overall it's a terrible app that's full of bugs and glitches that the developers couldn't be bothered to fix. Save yourself the trouble and just use the website.",
        "Over the past 2 years or so...it's just worse. I don't know how the hell the IPO is going to work with an App that consistently leads to frustrating browsing. Wanna back out of the thread and keep scrolling, welp too bad it's now refreshed good luck. Honestly using the browser isn't an option for 90% of us with smart phones don't want to use browser."

        "Malfunctions with bluetooth headset. Won't stay attached to headset's microphone, and headset's speaker sometime attaches at some crazily low volume and can only be fixed by turning the headset off and back on. (And yes, it's a zoom issue, not a headset issue... we just spent thirty minutes testing scenarios.) And just the basic fact that you cannot (and never have been able to) mute and unmute yourself by touching play/pause on the headset is ridiculous.",
        "I would've been a 5 star review but lately Bluetooth devices only work if I connect them before joining the meeting. Even when I do that there are a number of bugs that can cause the meeting to stop playing through the Bluetooth device. This is very frustrating. It is not always practical to leave and rejoin a meeting, just to get the app to cooperate with my Bluetooth audio devices. This is very basic functionality and it astounds me that a company such as zoom is incapable of fixing it.",
        "I love zoom because it's convenient and accessible to most but there are a few technical issues that I keep running into. One, it randomly kicks me off especially if I go to another app and it didn't use to do that! I should focus on one thing at a time but I like to multitask and now I can't without getting kicked off the meeting. My other criticism is that if you leave or get kicked out the whole friggin chat disappears (annoying but I accept that). Oh! Also too many bombers but the update.",
        "If I have bad wifi reception then it can freeze momentarily or become glitchy. But I do not think this has anything Todo with the quality of the app. I am pleased with the easy functionality of zoom. It's easy to register, sign in, and attend important group meetings and classes! It saves you log in info so if you have attended a certain zoom room before, you won't have to re-look up the room #. This is great for me because I am so unorganized most days. Thank you Zoom!",
        "Excellent quality of video calls for both audio and video. Poor user experience otherwise, and despite zoom seeing massive adoption since the pandemic started, their UI has seen few, if any, improvements. Basic table stakes features don't exist or are hidden behind cryptic menus and UI elements. Things that should take one or two actions involve navigating multiple layers of menus and screens. Still the best for having a consistently good conference call, but actually using the app sucks"

        "I kinda love this app. It's really nice. I absolutely adore the ability to search for moods and how well you can design your character. I like that it will match you up with friends and give you little stories. Can we add friends to the phone conversations? If they number matches up is it possible for me not to have to log into bitmoji-to find out joint pictures?",
        "It's a shallow app, the emoji designs lack character, many are very bad, and it's just templates, a single avatar retrofited onto cutouts. They need to be redesigned to match the avatars better, as well as light to the eyes, cause they kinda look dead. The app is also lacking in options and features, usually apps like this allow you to import images, even if they need to be reviewed, but no. They don't even have a write on or edit font option, I can't even create my own template.",
        "I really love playing with it, it's great for birthdays and just having fun. Sending regular messages this adds a little extra fun . I hate the fact that they don't have a lot of outfits they really need to get more clothing and the accessories, LOTS & LOTS & LOTS MORE clothing & accessories. Women need to change daily😉REALLY🤨🧐. It is addictive so play responsibly",
        "The app works great, but I wish it had more updated images or the ability to customize the wording on the images. The same images have been on here for the 5-6 years I've been using it. The \"good morning/evening/night\"- all the same, nothing new. I use another app and you can't type the text you want on the image. This app needs updating. No problems with it crashing, freezing, etc.",
        "I really love all the options you get to choose from. There are so many different hairstyles and they just keep adding more! The only problem is that you have to pick a gender. Most apps and games have made that optional (or not a thing at all), and I don't think it's fair that that's still an option, ESPECIALLY sense anyone can look any sort of way. Men can have bigger lips. Women can have facial hair. And people can have totally different genders entirely. Please change this and I will rate 5"

        "I have no complaints about this app. Unifi caught my attention while researching ISP equipment replacements, and after purchasing and deploying the UDM PRO a year ago, well let's just say I have become addicted to the product line. My Unifi ecosystem has effectively and completely satisfied every expectation of how a home network should be. Maybe I have just been lucky, but every device, from controller, switches, AP's, and camera's have worked absolutely flawlessly.",
        "This app is broken. It constantly pops up a window to unlock its data, requiring a fingerprint. This will intrude into every other app and at times make the phone nearly useless because as soon as you dismiss the popup it comes right back. I am not an IT professional, but I have deployed and managed many thousands of dollars of UniFi gear across multiple sites. The gear works wonderfully. This app does not.",
        "2/17/2022 - Update - Not showing connected clients, just spins. What now? --------------------------------------------- Works perfectly. I can see what devices are connected easily. I am not liking that lots of devices are not showing their names but only the IP address. A suggestion to allow custom naming and the ability to print a list of devices would be great",
        "Still Broken!!! App will no longer connect to Unifi CloudKeygen2 controller. Its been broken for over 10 months now. Ubiquiti acknowledges the issue but is unwilling to fix it. This company regularly releases software that breaks their hardware or removes basic functionality then is unwilling to provide any substantive support. To support: I have already opened two cases about this issue. I was told flat out, the app will no longer connect to the controller without cloud enabled. Not happening!",
        "So far a little off..... Status LED needs to be re-enabled EVERY TIME. Why? Why does it have to discover my standalone device, EVERY TIME? Theres no way to save it. Well see how this goes.....so far its not as shiny as what the youtubers show.... Edit 3/9/22: latest update/firmware of AC LITE no longer able to modify settings. Doesn't connect."

        "Love it. Just wish the videos and photos we upload had a better quality. Edit: So whenever I share videos of other pages to my story, IG crashes. Everytime I try to open it, it crashes right away. I'd have to uninstall and reinstall it back for it to start working again. Super annoying. Update: Recently when I post photos it shows them in a whirl and messes up some of my pictures. I have to delete the entire post then repost. Such a waste of time.",
        "Making a post on Instagram is such a tedious process. If one little thing goes wrong, which frequently happens due to many small bugs in post-making (including the infamous \"there was an error in editing your post\"), it sets you back to the beginning and you have to choose, crop, re-tag, and order every picture for your post over and over again. There have been multiple occasions where I've spent over 45 minutes trying to get a post live, and it leads to an incredibly frustrating experience.",
        "I logged out and can't log back in. White screen. When the app was working, I could never find music in the search bar either. If I choose a genre in the options that are available, nothing comes up. For instance, of I choose \"hip hop\" and y'all the button, the next screen loads for too long then says \"nothing found\". This has been going on for about a year when I discovered this was an option. I've deleted the app and reinstalled several times and restarted my phone several times as well.",
        "Not sure what they did to it, but trying to add multiple pictures just screws the whole thing up. It replaces pictures, and even tries to post the replaced pictures. The only way to get the original pictures back, is to save it as a draft, but when you try to save a draft it deletes all of your edits. If they fix it, then great, but until then...",
        "Over the last few months, whenever I try to upload a multiple-photo post and edit the photos, all of the photos in the set change to whatever photo I was editing. All of them. If I click another photo, they all turn into that one. It's incredibly frustrating, and I either have to do one photo at a time, or edit them all outside of the app before posting."

        "I love this clock but it just stops working out of the blue. Things will be going fine and then suddenly the alarms will stop working or the timer won't go off. This has happened multiple times since downloading it. A clock app is something that needs to be reliable and it's so frustrating this one isn't. Especially since I am a YouTube music subscriber and I like listening to my music as my alarm.",
        "My alarm isn't going off for some reason. Use to work. Haven't tampered with it. Still says set to go off at 'whatever time' from \"now\" as if it's armed, I've checking all the settings (volume, type, etc) Just stopped working for some reason. Had to download a more reliable alarm, I'd be late for work everyday if I trusted this one.",
        "It was easy to set up. Alarms went off for me but the setting to use volume buttons to snooze doesn't work no matter what I do. The biggest annoyance for me is that when I set a timer it doesn't alarm when the timer expires. Instead when I check your phone to see how much time is left it shows a negative amount of time. When I click on that time to open the app suddenly it starts alarming. I'm using a brand new galaxy s22 plus.",
        "Bottom line: don't trust it, use something else until it's fixed. Just adding my voice to the chorus advising that this app is terribly broken after the Android 12 update, especially for countdown timers, which run but don't advise you in any way that the time is up (not even if you're actively using your phone...you'll simply go back to the app after you remember and it will show how long it's been since it was supposed to go off).",
        "Love the app, *hate* the incredibly low contrast text. It seems the UX team assumes that people only use this app in bed, but I use the alarm feature all the time throughout the day. I have poor vision, and the small, low-contrast text is really difficult to read, and that's with the phone's Display/Font size both set to \"Large\". I don't want to change the whole phone's contrast -- just the clock app. Please improve the text contrast or at least make it modifiable."

        "NOT a Great game, used to be! I've played it on and off for years... More and more lately the game has froze, reset, and even started up after if played hours before at various points with less progress than I closed the game with. Sometimes losing bitizens who'd recently moved in with a dream job at a place in my tower, or one who had a pet, or having changed ones job, evicted one or any number of things which lost progress to such an extent that the game is becoming an extreme WASTE OF TIME!",
        "It's great. If you only get the VIP if you ABSOLUTELY plan on keeping the game long-term, then it's definitely worth it despite how pricy it is. Also, I love how easy it is to make bux to spend on things the longer you keep your current tower. Plus, the more times you prestige and get golden ticket floors, the faster and faster it becomes to get to level 50 and prestige again. 10/10 time killer - 0/10 actual engaging and fun video game experience.",
        "I used to play this game as a child and I can definitely say it is one of the best mobile I've played, it's the perfect thing to just hop on real quick in the morning and stock your stores, or build a new floor, it is certainly one of best games of it genre. And while it does include advertisements as well as in-app purchases, Ads are only if you play them yourself for rewards, and in app purchases are very well balanced, you can still have a great time without buying additional bux or coins.",
        "This game is one of my favorites. I've redownload it with every phone I get. It is much better than tiny tower Vegas, honestly. I do not like how much each floor goes up in money and time it takes to build.. the money you got to pay to build VS how much money you actually make makes the game kinda bad on that part. It's annoying but I still love it and it's a cute game. Nice to help pass a little time here and there.",
        "I just reinstalled Tiny Tower, Disco Zoo and Pocket Frogs. They're all games I've played before, and always enjoyed. However, the sound for these games does not work. Restarting the apps, restarting the phone, and repeatedly turning sound settings off and on do not work. Ads and other apps play sound with no issue; the games are the problem. Please help."

        "If there is one thing this should do well, it is give you a reliable calendar for today and tomorrow. This app is sadly unreliable. Most of the time it does great, but sometimes it will have no calendar content for long periods of time, it even worse, show you that you have an afternoon meeting but skip the morning ones. Needs to prioritize what content to sync better.",
        "I've used Outlook on multiple devices for almost ten years and prefer this to any other emal provider. I have never had any issues with their services or features. My only request would be to have the ability to manage categories and add/change categories to new events in the mobile version. A calendar widget that shows the month and categories would be fantastic. Thank you!",
        "I don't normally go out of my way to leave reviews for apps, but I'm hoping this gets the attention of the developers because there's an extremely annoying flaw/glitch/bug that I've been experiencing for ages now. I'll go to delete a whole bunch of emails and close the app afterwards, just to come back to the app later and find all those deleted emails back in my inbox again. There's no way I'm the only one experiencing this and I wish they would fix it already. It can't be that hard.",
        "Generally useful, but some features (like deleting blocs of emails when only one really needs to go, or making backups difficult to make and harder to access) are annoying and counterproductive. Sometimes too much \"convenience\" is a bad thing. Online support is complicated and mostly useless. Get help with YouTube. Amateurs helping amateurs, but helping. Plus, the human support is typical Microsoft. Ugh.",
        "Takes up too much storage space on my phone. Considerably larger than all other apps. Cannot locate a means to decrease it at all. Going to have to remove the app entirely since it's suddenly higher than usual, and my phone keeps popping up error messages. The Contact Developer email is a noreply address. How do prove you don't give a damn about your app users for 100, Alex."

It is borderline unusable with constant connectivity issues, song download/addition errors, music that \"hiccups\" at random points during playback, irritating messages, the list goes on and nothing short of phone restarts, if you're lucky, help. This is sad, Apple, and you need to fix this. Shame on you.",
        "I have no clue what happened to the Apple music app. I have used this app for over 2 years and I've had zero issues and then all of a sudden I've had nothing but issues. There are so many bugs in this app it is so ridiculous. The app keeps crashing, songs that show load don't load or take forever to load, and says I'm offline when my phone is connected to internet. Not sure what happened at all this app used to have no problems whatsoever. All these problems started all of a sudden.",
        "Can't go wrong with this one. I've found Apple's music archives to be much more extensive than that of an Amazon or Play Music. Has all the music I've bought from iTunes over the past several years and finds anything I'm looking for. $9.99 a month is a steal. Having one minor First World Problem- the widgets don't accurately reflect what's currently playing. My device anyway.",
        "They need to play a lot of catch up with Spotify. The Android version of this app is not super responsive. Hiding the like button in a sub menu is terrible design. I shouldn't need to wait for a song to load in order to skip it. The personal radio is sometimes excellent and other times it seems like I'm getting the recommendations of a very different person. Dolby Atmos is amazing, though."

      "comments": [
        "UPDATE - 4.9.0 - it appears they fixed the map issue noted below. Now, if they would enable you to swipe the charging station area down to minimize it, that would be terrific. Ok, the map is fixed BUT, IT WILL NO LONGER HOLD THE CAR CENTERED ON THE MAP. You have to keep hitting the CENTER arrow to keep it centered on the map.",
        "One of the recent updates broke the car tracking capability. Before the upgrade, one could keep track of the location of the car as it was moving - the symbol for the car would be centered in the screen, while the map underneath would move. This is not there any more: it is now the symbol for the car that keeps moving, whereas the map stays static - which of course implies that one has to move the map by hand, in order to keep track of the car. Hopefully this is just a snafu that Tesla will fix soon; my fear is, however, that some GUI nitwit at Tesla has decided that this is better.",
        "In recent months, the app has gotten much worse at waking the car up and allowing me to remotely access functions. Even when the car's connected to wifi or a strong cellular signal, the app often never connects to the car. Also, the 'phone as key' function will also fail when I am at the vehicle. Restarting the phone or toggling Airplane Mode off-on-off usually fixes the problem, but is very inconvenient. This is disappointing because these are new problems in the last 3 years",
        "The location map display is the worst I've ever seen in 4.8 1025. The default zoom is way too large. If you zoom in to actually see where the car is it zooms out again in about 6 seconds making it useless. The button to center the display on the car no longer moves the map with the car so you can't follow the car. The map is still in dark mode all the the time and continues to be unreadable by adults.",
        "Decent when it actually works. So far it has been basically unusable in service mode (app either doesn't load or errors out if it does get past the initial loading / black screen), which makes it awfully difficult to communicate with the service team. Responsiveness of the app in general leaves a bit to be wanting, but the issue while in service mode is what really prompted the review."

        "I generally like this app, but the 20,000 song limit really bugs me. I have my whole music collection on my phone and it sucks that I can't access the whole thing. Also, why does no decent/ad-free app allow a feature to sort/ filter by year? It would be nice when making playlists to include this feature. Say I wanted to make a playlist called \"my senior year\", it would be much easier if I could sort by year. Seems like an easy and obvious feature to have, yet NO apps have it.",
        "The app is quite good. It's good on most features that the average person would consider important such as interface, ease of access, functionality, etc. Recently, however, I've been experiencing an issue with the volume insofar as it will constantly fluctuate and become muffled during playback regardless of sound settings or max volume. If this issue is addressed (and soon), I'd consider raising my current rating. Until then, though, I have to keep it at 3 Stars!",
        "This has to be the best music player app for me ever. It's so easy to just download music, have it save to your files app - which automatically saves it to your Samsung Music songs library. You can do this with any song from youtube or anywhere else you download music. I have had no issues with this app and it's always been my go-to app for playing music anytime I want. The best part is having no ads because of having your own downloaded tracks. :)",
        "It's disappointing to have a music player that offers playlist but once a playlist is selected it won't play the playlist, it plays the all the songs that are in the music library instead. So when in a mood and want to listen to something different and just those particular songs on a certain list and I've got to listen to everything instead. Defeats the whole purpose of having playlists then.",
        "Bug that needs fixing: sometimes a song will be finished playing but will suddenly replay the current song even though the playback has been exceeding the song's duration. Example: song runtime 1:20, won't continue to the next song until 1:55, the song doesnt just repeat the app treats it as one continuous track. I have no idea how this can happen. otherwise, great app"

        "Easy to use and has good decisions for user experience, like the card number copying to clipboard with a single tap instead of a hold-\"copy\" style. The biggest addition I would make is I would like to see far more in the way of customizations for the cards. More colors, more icons to choose from, more to individualize the cards so I know what I'm selecting at a quick glance.",
        "Love this service! I use these virtual cards for basically every online purchase. I ensure that I'm protected in case any of those services get hacked, I can easily pause or delete that card. The support has always been super responsive and helpful. They have taken suggestions and researched making the service easier to use. I recommend this service to all my friends.",
        "Excellent program. I use it for everything now. To be able to pause or restart card us priceless. I have one for Amazon. One for auto zone. One for netflix. Etc. You change yourdinding source in an instant. I love it. Glad banksate slow to come r it because privacy does it better. I had another through a bug brick and mortar bank and I rather on line. Aaaaaa+++++++++",
        "I love the idea, but I haven't been able to use the app at all yet. Two of my bank accounts are being claimed as unsupported and I can't link individual debit cards because I have a bank linked which was required at the start. And any time I attempt to make changes to the funding sorce my account is put under review for the next two days. I have multiple accounts for multiple expenses like business or personal and not being able to link them all defeats the purpose for me.",
        "This is great!!! I can finally ditch PayPal for paying for things online!!!! It's much safer too. Super easy start up and use. Basically you just add the card you want to use online and when you go to pay for something you can make a virtual card that can only be used with that vendor(after the first use). You could set limits to make sure you don't get charged extra or make it one time use only so you can't get hit with a payment after a trial ends etc. Unless Privacy gets hacked, the card's ok"

        "It's good. It does what it's suppose to. 99% of the time. But lacks a lot of quality of life features. It has a upload bar, but doesn't tell you what's being uploaded at the moment. Just all files. It will desync, but doesn't tell you at what file. It doesn't question if you have uploaded the same file multiple times via file name. Google drive as a whole, needs to add a tag system for easy discovery.",
        "The app is great, super convenient just like the online version. But, trying to upload multiple and/or large media files is dreadful! Most times I have to attempt to upload them at least 3 times, 2 different ways to get the files to upload. It will literally show that it is uploading for several hours, but the files will never completely upload... unless I start over again.",
        "Update: after doing what Google suggested, it helped. I see my files now. Hopefully, they stay there and don't disappear. Thanks for the suggestion. ------------ Doesn't show all my files. I took a lot of time on my new computer setting up Google drive, transferred a lot of files and they successfully uploaded. They're not on my Google drive app, yes, I checked computers. Google man, you guys need to work on your apps. They stink!!",
        "This app is okay. I cannot transfer files from Google Drive to Google Photos which is bad. I also have this issue where I accidentally \"edit\" a file and the \"last modified\" date becomes today instead of when it was created. To make this app better in my opinion, I would either request a sort by creation date option or a way to switch to a previous version of the file. I can't find the option to do either and it bothers me when the dates are messed up. Overall, this app is okay. Have a great day!",
        "Google Drive is a good idea from a company that has given us plenty of innovation over the years. Their free cloud storage space can’t be touched by anyone else (Microsoft offers 5 GB, a third of the 15 GB, that Google offers). And yet, Google Drive has disappointed me more than I’d like to admit. My biggest issue involves doing backups from my Android smartphone. The Android app allows you to view and upload content to your Google Drive account. But one thing I dislike is that the app doesn’t allow you to upload an entire parent folder and all its child folders recursively. If you have a lot of content on your phone that’s organized hierarchically, in order to use the app, you have to create the folder structure in the app yourself, and then queue up the uploads for each folder, one at a time. This seems to be a limitation with the Android operating system, as what appears when you select Add >> Upload is a system-generated dialog where you can only choose files, not a folder. But since Google is in charge of both Drive and Android, this is an issue they are able to resolve. The other issue I’ve experienced with Google Drive is the performance. I have 5G service to my smartphone and sometimes am in cells where the service isn’t as strong. I have set the app to use mobile data explicitly (that is, not to wait for a wi-fi connection). Yet, on too many occasions I’ve seen the familiar rotating progress rings, spinning in place, with the message “Waiting For Network” under the file name, even if a network is available. Google Drive’s web service from a desktop or laptop browser is much better, and if you have the opportunity to use that, I’d recommend that instead. And if you only have occasional data to upload, the app is sufficient for quickie backups. But if you have anything hierarchical, or have a large number of files to upload, you’ll experience the same frustrations I have."

        "Detects that there's a tracker nearby but does nothing when trying to play the sound. There's no sense of where it is on the app either like when using the iPhone version. The NFC tag reader on my Galaxy S20 did not pick it up either. It just kept looking for it but no matter where I positioned it I could not get the phone to pick it up. Also a security flaw about instructing how to disable it may have been overlooked. I just hope it works well with my iPhone when I actually do lose something.",
        "Good to have this on Android platform. Appreciate being able to manually scan and it does not have to run in the background. It would be a better implementation to allow optional background running. For example, to automatically scan while you are traveling or stationary and not watching the screen. This could ease some of concerns, but still satisfy both methods of scanning. This would also allow more frequent scans over a longer period to find 15 minutes away from the offenders.",
        "I'm sorry, but from what I gather, this app seems pointless. Lemme tell you why. 1, it doesn't continuously run in the background even by option, so you have to constantly check. 2, from what one screen says, it doesn't pick up on air tags until 15 minutes after it's out of Bluetooth range of owner's device. Pretty sure by that time it's pointless and too late. Apple might have had good intention, but this was absolutely a horrible execution.",
        "Was hoping for an option to have this running in the background. If I'm already under the impression an Apple tag is around me that shouldn't be, I probably don't need to take that moment to open an app to scan and confirm suspicions. I thought it would scanning in the background, the way it seems it does for Apple. At least the option for continual scanning, for the malignant use of a tracking device, would be much more helpful. Do better Apple.",
        "Couple issues: Press the button to scan and it just starts scanning, never stops until you tell it to. There's nothing to indicate how long it *should* take to find a wayward tracker. Should it be instantaneous if it needs the criteria? Who knows? Maybe they ping Bluetooth every 30s. A minute. You don't know. As most have noted there isn't any background scanning. That would chew through battery and may not be doable with Droid using a third party app, but it's still a big limitation."

        "attempting to order groceries is incredibly glitchy. almost every time i've tried, the app freezes or crashes at least twice. i've been trying to put an order in for half an hour, but it freezes as soon as i go to checkout. also, for regular takeout, they artificially inflate the prices of each item and THEN charge $10-$15 dollars in fees on top of that. i know y'all ain't strapped for cash, there's no reason to do this.",
        "The app works fine, but I am Uninstalling because it is a rip off. Over the past few months they have risen prices on EVERYTHING. Just ordering one simple item that should be $10 to $20 ends up being $35 after an increased price, delivery fees, additional fees, taxes, and then a tip on top. It also got to the point where I would HAVE to add on an additional express fee just to ensure I get my food in a timely manner, otherwise I would get luke warm soggy food long after it was picked up.",
        "Delivery has been very reliable and with a feeling of security. I have only had good experiences with Uber eats. I get good deals and prices are fair. It's great for last minute plans and times are fast to reasonable. I've never been disappointed in delivery. I usually am familiar with the places I order from. I've tried new places and have enjoyed that but was disappointed in only one restaurant when reordering. It's great for people who don't drive or can't get out.",
        "More incorrect orders than correct, as well as unreliable times or drivers. On tip of uber screwing drivers they won't refund order, if you get too many incorrect. Because we have control of that as customers. Try any other app. The surcharges are crazy, on top of \"temp ones\". Plus if you live in a tax free state for purchases, they'll find a way to pass an extra charge to you.",
        "The ability to get help with your order is astoundingly difficult through the app when it comes to tipping. I've been trying to find a way to amend my tip, which is nonexistent at the moment because of said issue, for the last 30 minutes & all I get is a search bar with finite, basic search terms & no connection to someone live who may have a solution. It's inconvenient for me to call y'all. At THAT membership price, plus the \"service fees\" & poor wages, I'd want at least better app service."

        "Far too many irrelevant notifications. Constant notifications from the app itself about features they have, and no way to turn them off without disabling all notifications. We use this app for coordinating our marching band, and these junk notifications are useful to no one. The app is generally very slow to load, which is a big issue over a variable mobile phone connection.",
        "5/2/22 Update; Having trouble with Band not alerting audibly on some chat messages. Sent in a message to the help line and was told to send screenshots..... of a noise that isn't happening. Not sure what to do. Still frustrated with tripping on the functions are only on the phone app vs the website. Also I REALLY wish that the names in the sign-ups didn't grey out when the slots are full. The text is so TINY that it almost disappears when it goes grey. One other question. Is there any chance that Band will start tracking cumulative hours for community service groups. I really need that function! Starting to look around for something that can do both, even a paid app. Sign-Up Genius can do some of this, but it is pricy at that level. I wouldn't mind paying something, but they are a bit high. Great app, especially for free! The ability to do signups and polls is really helpful. Definitely helps with communications, especially with chronically non-communicative teens! Couple suggestions; 1. It would help if I could see who has read group chats, not just how many people. 2. It REALLY needs a \"users manual\", as opposed to a bunch of clips. Biggest complaint I get, and has kept my older leaders from using it well. 3. Having all of the functions work on the app AND the website. Thanks!",
        "Its ok. Pros- makes it really easy to keep the office up to date with current job progress and its a easily navigated app most of the options are self explanatory. Cons- im constantly having to close and reopen the app to get it to load pages the app seems to double post frequently and load times are kinda slow lately the pages are loading up as blank pages and i have to close the app and re open it to get it to load (edit-- the app is quickly becoming the bane of my existence)",
        "Overall easy, efficient and useful! I like that it is easy to manage a lot of tasks in one place. Two things I would like to see added is admin rights to assign/remove roles; as needed, and admin ability to move photos between albums; as well as input your own album dates",
        "This app is the worst. I download it for our kids dance classes in order to watch the live stream. For the first few months it worked just ok. Over the past few weeks it constantly freezes. Only way to get it to work is to force stop the app and go back in. Even then you can only watch a minute or two before it happens again. I cleared cache and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I am not the only one with this issue. There are multiple parents in the dance class that have this problem."

        "No option to display only contacts with phone numbers, one of the most basic features in every contacts app in every other phone I've ever had. Unfortunately, my new phone came preinstalled with this garbage with no other option but to take my chances with finding something else in the play store. The fact that this app is missing one of the most basic, common, and necessary features is a huge FAIL!",
        "Poorly programmed, no options, one size doesn't fit all. My biggest issue with this app is very simple, but very annoying. I search for someone, I call them, finish the call. If I want to call someone in favorites...., I click on Favorites, but there's nobody there, because the search filter is still on (also, no dial option while searching)...so I have to back out of the search function and then it works. It's simple, when I hit Favorites can't you automatically clear the search?",
        "When this app works correctly it is wonderful. It can save so much time. But when it doesn't work it is a pain! Searching is hit or miss. If I search for someone I'm about 50% likely to find the person I'm looking for. If I set labels on users to group them, sometimes I can search for the label sometimes not. If I click on a label I usually only get partial results. Sometimes the label doesn't even appear in the person's entry for no apparent reason. Google PLEASE fix the plethora of search bugs",
        "'Contacts' is, as you would guess, an app that allows you to manage your contacts list. It works like it should, syncs automatically across all my devices, and has a clean UI. I rarely use the 'Contacts' app directly; I mostly interact with it through the contacts list in Google's Phone Dialer. It's powered by this app; you can test this out by disabling 'Contacts' and then trying to add a contact to Phone's contacts - it'll say \"No contacts app installed\". I like this app/service. Thanks.",
        "This app worked well before, but now, out of nowhere, the initial screen only shows the contacts that have been added by phone and not all phone contacts. Having to click another button to get to all the contacts is an annoyance that apparently can't be changed by choosing a different display option. Please fix as soon as possible."

        "Does exactly what I need it to do. Very simple, intuitive design. Not sure why ratings are mixed. I can view, and download my files onto my mobile device. I believe you can also upload, but for my usage, I'll just upload from home. I can login remotely via my home VPN, but this app is very convenient. Also great for users who aren't tech savvy to do that, and want to download a file off my NAS. If this is the purpose you need to fullfil, this is the app to do it.",
        "The NAS is great. This app sucks. Constant login issues, when it does let me connect, no files, or sometimes SOME files are visible. Have a similar issue with Drive now too. BUT...I can log in to DSM via Chrome on the same phone and access everything just fine....so the issue is just the app...not the NAS.",
        "I've had this for about 5 minutes and it found my NAS, browsed my directory, and opened a pdf for viewing, first on my LAN, then with WiFi turned off, using cell data. Not slow, not a hitch. Using an old Samsung S7 edge, DSM 7 updated. NB I addressed the NAS over the internet using my current home IP address, not a domain name, and http not https, bc I don't have a domain or a cert yet. So nothing was relayed by Synology servers as it is with Quick Connect. Dunno whether that makes any diff.",
        "Photo backup doesn't work as I expected it to. The initial backup process finished and reports the 'backup complete' status. However, it didn't back up a number of more recent photos (~300 files). I found no way to tell the app to continue syncing. And when I take a new picture, it doesn't sync up. I cleared the app cache and restarted it. Now it started to sync up the whole folder from scratch - creating duplicates in the NAS shared folder.",
        "I did used to like this app, however since the latest update it no longer remembers where you were in the file tree. So if you are in a directory looking for something, and click into a sub folder, if you go back to the previous directory, it places you in a different location than where you clicked in from, making manual searches nearly impossible in a large directory structure."

        "Consistently problematic. Between my phone and console, it just won't stay logged in for some reason. It does for a few weeks at a time, but then randomly decides to log me out; and if that weren't bad enough on its own, it seems to forget my login info each time! Like the only way to successfully log in is to change my password every single time. I like the app itself when it works, but I don't have this problem with Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Paramount etc.",
        "The app works pretty well, but it could be improved. 1. It doesn't continue to play a video when I minimize the app. 2. It takes longer to download a video than other streaming service apps. 3. It needs to be streamlined for poorer Internet speeds (those of us in rural communities would appreciate that). Pro: customer service has been great every time I've contacted them.",
        "HBOMax is excellent! I was thoroughly impressed with the selection of content available. Almost all of the HBO Original Programming is available along with all of the old classics that we love. I couldn't be happier to start The Sopranos again. What also impressed me a lot were the movies. There are a lot of movies available and I appreciate the DC content, all of the Batman content including the animated stuff. One complaint is the app sometimes slows down and freezes. I had to clear the cache.",
        "Had to rewrite my rating, The app crashes constantly (about every 20 seconds to every couple of minutes), and says that the show or movie can't be found or it's having trouble playing the video. When it's not crashing, it freezes but still plays the audio, then unfreezes and speed plays. I'm on the verge of just canceling my subscription and ditching this streaming app, this is too much of a hassle to simply watch a show or a movie.",
        "To the I.T. team, There has to be a way to solve these issues so many have commented. When I open the app, it goes directly to downloads with a warning that I'm offline. The setting to use Mobile data is selected but it continues to evert to the same warning page. The back button doesn't work from this page. I would be grateful for any suggestions."

        "Really liking the dsm 7 photos app. A few things i would like to see. 1. Recycle bin for photos and make it easy to see from within the app. 2. Auto backup when connected to a specific wifi only (home wifi). Also when I'm connected to a vpn it seems to try to sync endlessly and not stop when it can't connect. Make it stop trying after a couple failed attempts? 3. Would LOVE an option to auto compress pictures and video. Especially video. That's the thing i miss the most from Google photos.",
        "It is the best alternative for the Google photos app. I have two main issues with this app that doesn't let me to give it 5 stars. First, It only shows the pictures and videos that have already been backed up. It means it doesn't show the recently taken photos immediately. So it can't be used as the main photo app on your phone. Second, it uses other video players to play your videos. I like to have an embedded video player so I can go to the next picture or video without pressing the back btn.",
        "When I ran Moments, the photos that were sent to me via Messages were backed up as well as all the photos I took with my phone. It worked flawlessly. When I purchased a new Synology DS220+ with DiskStation 7, it no longer backed up photos sent to me with Messages. I've checked and double checked the settings several times both on my phone and on my DiskStation. It still does not backup photos sent via Messages.",
        "The new update to your Drive APP has new options to view and organize photos, but it can't \"see\" into the Photos folder that this APP uses. In turn, this APP can't see into my Drive folder to help organize those photos. I NEED a photo APP that can help me organize ALL of the photos on my NAS. Jumping between APPs is frustrating.",
        "Ew. I don't usually leave negative reviews, but for something this prolifically terrible, I'll make an exception. It's a buggy mess. Backup is buggy. Auto-clearing space after backup is buggy. The app actually recommends you use HTTP instead of HTTPS if your NAS uses a self-signed cert. It makes the recommendation directly in the app, right next to the option to use HTTP. I've worked in cyber security for over a decade. Self signed cert > no encryption. Ridiculous recommendation. Horrible app."

        "Horrible app in its current state. Needs massive improvements or let it die. I enjoyed the simplicity of GooglePlay. There is no reason to migrate. The new app doesn't work. Inaccessible movies, especially on PCs. Terrible interface. I spent a lot of $$$ over the years and I can't watch movies on my PC. WTH? Fix it or I want my $$$ back for all of my movie purchases.",
        "Suddenly telling me no internet connection, make sure Wi-Fi or cellular data is turned on, but my internet is working fine and signal is good. I deleted the app and reinstalled it, and still getting the same freaking message!!! Very annoying!!!!!! Then after reaching out to Google about this problem they reply with an answer that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the issue I'm having!!! 😡",
        "This app is destined for failure. To say that it's limited in its capabilities is an understatement. It does a better job suggesting shows and movies through services that you're not subscribed to then it does services that you are subscribed to. Did I mention that it doesn't include Netflix? How can you not have Netflix in your lineup of Channel offerings. Also, I am a YouTube TV subscriber it does not include the ability to pull up the channel list inside the app. Use Google Play. It's easier.",
        "Cannot adjust volume with phone. One of the worst most annoying things is to have to continuously get up and down to adjust the volume on my TV while streamkng. You'd think the Google TV app would fix this. This is the message I get when trying to adjust volume on my phone \"Surround sound enabled to adjust volume use your TV's remote\". Hulu, YouTube, Amazon prime video I can adjust the volume on my phone........ I'll just rent my movies on there from now on.",
        "What is this UI? It's completely unintuitive, painstakingly frustrating to navigate, and just an overall mess. Sure the old Play Movies and TV wasn't the flashiest looking thing, but at least I could find what I was looking for. This on the other hand, just down right unusable."

        "This is a fantastic emulator. Something I would add (unless it's already there but I just can't find it) is the ability to make certain buttons toggle able. For example, instead of having to hold the run button down in NSMB, it would be great if I could just press it once, and it'll hold it down for me.",
        "I've been using this for a long while but ever since I transferred the app and saves from my s9 to s20, the game speeds up and then crashes after every trainer encounter. It's not entirely unplayable, there's a work around but it's a hassle to do every few seconds in the game, killing the mood. As far as I know though, other games from my library work just fine, I'm just having these problems in pkmn hg",
        "So I have to say. I'm beyond impressed with this emulator. If you want to know if it's worth the price.... brother... yes. It's worth more. PLUS there is a beta program and there is a loving amount of customizability with the GUI vs. Controller/keyboard UI. You can do some creative stuff with the stylus (like map your right thumb stick to trace around like a stylus in fluid motion) So I just have to say to the developers that you did a great job. If you are willing to tinker... it's rewarding.",
        "Really amazing emulator, I actually like it more than any DS emulator I've used on the PC. Very easy to use and set up, as well as adjust the settings to my liking. No lag, no crashes, haven't had any save losses or any technical issues, really. If I could make one suggestion, it would be potentially adding more \"extra\" buttons. For instance, in Apollo Justice, it's often that the microphone has to be used in investigations. I have one button to make a save state, the second to load a save state, which means I have only one extra button I have to interchange fast forwarding and microphone activity onto. It's such a non-complaing though, it's barely a concern. I also think there should be an option to make the buttons and d-pad smaller, rather than just disabling them. All in all, totally worth the price, the performance of this app is above and beyond the experiences I've had with other emulators.",
        "For the first 2 weeks I used this emulator everything worked perfectly and I got everything I could possibly want out of it. But after a certain point the game I was playing started crashing. It was infrequent but it did occur. I thought changing games would cause the issue to go away, but rather it got worse. After a while the crashes became so frequent that any game was unplayable. I uninstalled the app and redownloaded it but no change. Unfortunate but hopefully something that can be fixed."

        "I'm so upset right now, I've had to stop for a little while but recently it's stopped working for me. Anytime I try to record a video the audio is off timing. Like the audio starts and I lip sing to it but it just glitches out at the end and it's way off timing. I've done everything in the book to try to help this. I've updated it, cleared catche, restarted, good Wi-Fi, nothing is working. I'm really upset.",
        "SO FRUSTRATING!!! I'm trying to make a new post and the app is forcing music over my videos. It does not give me the option to not have audio, when I do try to just pick my own audio and try to edit it it has this other sound that's playing over it and I cannot get it to stop. I don't even know where the sound is coming from, and if I try to upload two different clips that I want in the same post it forces music over it.",
        "The updates made everything change. Before the updates, the app was good and everything worked perfectly fine. Once the update happened though, the functions wouldn't work that well, at all. For example, I put a video as favorite and later on decide to unfavorite it it won't, same with the likes and following. When I try to share, duet, or switch, the app crashes. I also can't change any of the settings or anything involved with my account.",
        "App crashes all the time. It has crashed in the middle of editing and I've lost whole videos. When I'm scrolling the videos will go all white or all black and I have to get out of the app and start it up again. When recording it does this \"hicup\" thing and my video jumps and if I keep recording my mouth doesn't line up with my words so I have to keep pausing and re-recording. So many issues!",
        "I've never had any major issues with this app but whenever you save a video there's a giant menu that takes up 75% of your screen so every time I go to tap somewhere else I end up sharing a video on accident. Sharing and saving are two completely different actions and should not be part of the same menu, some of the most awful design out of any app I've ever used. UPDATE: I can't believe after literal months that this is still an issue, on top of that the auto generated captions setting is broke"

        "In the last several months door dash quality has dropped severely. Almost every order has been messed up. They offer partial refunds or credit that covers an item (s) missing or messed up but never the fees that add up quickly that you'd have to pay again to get your item!!!! If it was a one off it wouldn't be an issue but several times in a row from multiple places and then iffy customer service when you reach out to dash. Oh! And the best part, they say \"review\" the stores, then don't post it",
        "Wish double dash wasn't such a pain, I'd use it more. The menu for it is hard to navigate as you don't get the table of contents for a place, just a small bar at the top. For convenience stores with massive menus this is impossible to navigate, plus you gotta do it with a time limit ticking down. Then it always says the driver is waiting at one of the places when the map shows them between them. A pain to order Double Dash, annoying to track it. If you wanna discourage it, just don't offer it?",
        "I've got a high-end new phone, so a utility app like this shouldn't be buggy and glitchy. It's that simple. [Also, the lack of a search function from within a restaurant's menu is a needless annoyance. If I'm ordering Thai food (which I am), and want pad Thai (which I do), I should be able to search for it, rather than scroll through the entire menu.] I'm done giving 4- and 5-star ratings to basic apps. Give me some groundbreaking feature, and I'll accept the bugginess. But ordering food? Nah.",
        "I've been usimg DoorDash since 2018 when it first came out. It is by far the best delivery app out there in my opinion. I'ts really convient and food gets delivered super quickly. The only issues I have are how the full menu is not avaliable for most restaurants and customer service repersentitives sometimes are a bit iffy. (I've been hung up on, told there isn't anything they can do even though there is etc.) But other than that it's great! It's way to easy to order out now.",
        "If waiting 3 hours for food, just to get a text saying it's been canceled, or getting a photo of your food at some random person's house, or getting someone else's order, or getting cold food is what you want then you've come to the right place. The orders are correct, on time, and at the right place maybe 1 in 15 times you order, and instead of even remotely attempting to solve the issue, like waiting 3 hours to get a canceled order, you get a refund that doesn't include the tip and taxes. 0/10"

        "I love using this app and it has proven itself very useful on many different occasions. It has a lot of great features, but at the moment I'm dealing with a giant bug I've read other users are having that the Internet can't seem to help with. The dates shown for different photos have been completely jumbled. If I look under info for a particular photo it will show the correct day, or in an album, but just on the main screen it's made it very confusing trying to find anything. What should I do?",
        "Great to look at but don't try to edit. I use photos in my work as an inspector. In the past month the edit function has failed to launch. It either goes to a white screen and stays that way until I close the app or it closes the app completely. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, updated, turned off, restarted, checked my settings, and cleared the cache on all my devices. This glitch only affects my Acer chromebook, which is about 6 months old.",
        "I love the platform and all of it's features I just wish they'd allow you more options to categorize and edit photos yourself. Like if I create a collage I want to be able to arrange the photos or center them better than the auto generated collage that will not allow me to reposiston the photo. The facial recognition only allows the system to pick faces but will not allow you to identify a person in a photo so that it will show in that individuals folder. But other than that I think it's 👍🏽.",
        "This app's sync and backup work great for videos and photos. But it feels outdated. Making albums out of photos makes for a terrible time for searching. It would be great if there was a manual tagging system that allows users to have the ability to create tags and organize photos. Filtering photos by multiple tags would definitely make searching for the right photo fast and easy. There are currently no app with both a tagging and backup/syncing functionality. Hope google photos can be the first.",
        "I love most of the app. Photos can be nicely organized and saved in albums. It syncs with your phone's gallery. The one thing I've discovered to watch for is that if you delete an album in the shared section it will delete that album entirely. I lost 3 extremely valuable and sentimental albums full of pics that weren't saved anyplace other than Google photos. So just be careful, it's easy to do and there aren't any warnings."

        "This app is really good at helping someone step by step with building a business plan. It's a lot to read but very simple and direct I even enjoy the samples skits that are a part of each lesson. I have truly dove into the first 4 lessons and it was quite insightful and gave me a lot to think about. Would love to see some reward points get added to this like other Google services have.",
        "Actually not a bad app at all. A lot of it may seem a little redundant, like common sense stuff, but there's still quite a bit of good, valuable information to be had, and really doesn't hurt to have a reminder for stuff that you already know, as it can be easy to overlook things when you are busy with prioritizing how the newer concepts will fit into your method. Really like how the app helps guide you along through quizzes, \"to-dos\", and helps you map/form your mission statement, etc.",
        "Honestly, this application is really helpful. It is just like a counselor in a school or college, but right on your hands. It is a teacher in your hands who's ready to teach you whenever you want to or need to. I like this application on the aspect of the information provided that a student needs. Content is good, and havent found any issues on running the app properly. Good initiative. That is why I rate it a 5 out of 5.",
        "Gives bite size lessons and you can pin certain parts that you may want to see later. Is great for someone with little to no experience who's just getting into the fields included. Makes things easy to read and understand. Plus there's a little workbook-type section at the end of some lessons to help you take necessary steps or do tasks that will move you along in your journey to wherever you're trying to go in said field. It's an easy to use app and very helpful.",
        "I absolutely love the ease of following through the lessons. Even more so I love that they are interactive all the way through. This app provides the teachings that I've Google searched in a convenient way. Everything is practical including the advice they give, the examples they use, and the structure of the lessons."

        "Overall great app. Very useful. Would be nice to be able to create a new calendar from within the app instead having to do it from computer. I also wish there was a quicker way to get to older calendar dates. (There used to be an easy way when I had an iPhone 4.) Who wants to scroll through every month to see events from a previous year? An UNDO option would also be awesome. TO GOOGLE REPLY: Great, thanks! I will definitely do that!",
        "Can't believe they removed the ability to assign each event an individual color. What were you thinking there?!? That was like the main reason I found this calendar useful. This thing is junk now. Thanks a lot Google, not sure what's going on with you guys recently (past 3-5 years) but this is just a small example of a much larger set of problems with your products lately",
        "Calendar app icon doesn't reflect current date and month unless you click on it. It just shows \"31\" coming from iphone interface I am used to just looking at the calendar app and seeing Today's date. I am aware there is a widget on top and for time, date, weather. But, I noticed date and month Fonts are so small compare to time. Just a small tweek would make a big difference by just adding current date into calendar app itself.",
        "Calendar notifications open the wrong events. Editing scheduled events also creates additional one time events by themselves that by default sets itself to all-day. UPDATE: As of 11-06-21 The app is still pulling up the wrong event when clicking on a notification. Now 1 star instead of 2 for taking so long to fix the issue. UPDATE: As of 5-29-22 It looks like they finally fixed the issue. 4 stars now. It would be 5 stars if when done editing events the app didn't create duplicate events.",
        "Pretty solid, if I do say so myself. Although the new interface is very confusing. It's been a bit since I've last opened Google calander, I've finally wanted to get my life together, and decided to use a nice, trusted company to help me with that. Google. Only to see my previous memory of this apps interface completely wash away. The side scrolling view for the calender when you open the app is very unusual to say the least. Not what I'm used to, but hey, its free with no ads. Who cares."

        "A must have app in your phone, if you are using bluetooth devices. I was able to find my galaxy watch through this app and it helped me to pin point the location (the watch was not getting connected to phone and was lost in the room's vicinity). One of the best feature is it keeps on telling approx distance of the bluetooth divice from your phone. It should be a default feature in the android/apple phones. Great job👍",
        "A Great app for scanning nearby BLE Devices and getting the distance . This app really works and it also allows users to get data from any device and in tabular form also. Great job. Easy to use and works fine with lots of Bluetooth devices.😀 The app works great with Bluetooth V4 devices, but when I tried to scan for Bluetooth v2 devices it was not visible, if there is a way to add that feature it would be great.",
        "It's help me to find hidden cameras. Depending on the device you're using it can give different distances eg, meters is sometimes centimeters away.",
        "Thank you for creating this app. You are such wonderful person. It helps me find my missing smartwatch which is hiding at myGintell Massage chair. Both devices have Bluetooth. But can be differentiated by its MAC numbers.",
        "It works I just wish it'd help you figure out the devices that don't have a manufacturer. Maybe some help with looking up devices with the available information. Not everyone knows what the data is telling them"

        "Do you like your music streaming app that you're paying for crashing more often than necessary? Then Spotify is the perfect choice for you! Even with the screen turned off, it'll just crash and force me to reopen the app and restart the music in the middle of work. But if the app crashing wasn't good enough for you, if you have android 12, Spotify will just beg for more Bluetooth permissions than necessary, and the team is aware of this, but are working at a snails pace to get it fixed.",
        "I've been using Spotify for a long time and it's worked wonders! But recently, the song stops mid-way for no reason! I check the app and the icon in the bottom to pause and play the song isn't there, then I have to shuffle my playlist again. Another thing is anytime I want to add new songs I can't hear a preview. For me I used to be able to hit loop on songs but now I'm not allowed to anymore (if it was changed to a premium feature I wasn't aware of that, sorry.) Besides that the app is great!",
        "Great music selection, but the player itself gets glitchy, necessitating frequent restarts. I've also had to uninstall and then reinstall the app several times, since, for some reason, it was draining all of my available phone memory. Also, at times, I've had to restart my phone, since Spotify kept messaging me that I was offline and could not therefore engage my playlist, even though my internet connection was at full capacity. The app is a bit of an annoyance, but I've learned to live with it.",
        "I've been using this app for years and have never found much issue in it. Though over the past month or so there has been an ENORMOUS increase in glitches and bugs that causes the app to crash. Please fix this. I don't want to have to switch music players, but I will if things don't change. (Edit) Issues still not fixed.. and more problems are showing up too. I'm VERY close to deleting the app and switching music players. And I know for a fact that other people are too.",
        "I love this app. I use it to listen to music damn near every day. But why in the HELL did the developers deem it necessary to rearrange the play and skip buttons in the latest update? I've accidentally skipped songs while trying to pause it so many times thanks to this update. I've also been having an issue for months where my music will pause on its own while I'm listening on my phone, and when I press play again, it starts over from the beginning rather than at the spot I left off from."

        "Good enough. The categories system sucks though. The auto-fill doesn't work half of the time. It either doesn't detect the form (app or website), or when it does and you pick a credential, it doesn't fill it out. The other half of the time it works well. Some room for improvement, but I would still recommend it.",
        "Bitwarden is a great password manager. I use it for work, school, and personal use. The app itself is kind of hit and miss. Autofill doesn't work sometimes. Sometimes the app doesn't recognize a password field (maybe a website issue). Sometimes it doesn't even recognize a website. Once in a while it shows the wrong password to select for autofill. When it does work, it's awesome and when it doesn't it's just a minor inconvenience. I still recommend using it.",
        "Pretty good system. Switched from LastPass because I couldn't make it work. Bitwarden is dedinitely much more user friendly and I can always get my password into the field on a login page. I still haven't quite figured out how to always get the right URL into rhe website field, specially when I'm setting up a new account or changing a password. But I'll get there. The Help is quite good. I use it regularly😄. Thank you for creating a highly effective password locker that is easy to use.",
        "An excellent password manager. Open source is a plus. Constantly improving. The ability to log into multiple accounts and switch between them is awesome. It makes managing my parent's account much easier. More services should have this feature. However, Bitwarden REALLY needs a tagging feature. Right now it only has folders, and being unable to apply multiple tags to an entry is incredibly irritating. It makes managing a large number of sites/passwords a chore.",
        "Very frustrating. It's never running, so it never automatically fills in passwords, so have to manually open every time. Why do I need to have the app open and maximized ALL THE TIME for it to even function? Doesn't recognize pages there are already passwords stored for, so I have to re-save every time, leading to 12 entries for the SAME THING. All I'm doing is saving, for no reason. Downloaded it because it was a top recommendation, but it's literally useless on my Android. Hate hate hate."

        "The app itself is ok. I can use it and all that. BUT the customer service interface is atrocious. There's no place for me to type in what my issue is if it isn't listed and if I do manage to get someone after searching through all the options to chat to a person I get handed off to another person. Is it within the app and the texting window? Of course not! They said they'll get back to me by email. For the record my issue was that I can rate my driver but I cannot tip them. I'm up to date too.",
        "Overall very good. Sometimes the estimated prices are ridiculously high, but if you wait a few minutes and check again, they will often drop. My biggest complaint is that I've had several instances where I drivers matched to me and is shown as being on the way, and then cancels after I've already been waiting for a while. My other complaint is about the app itself. When you have booked a ride in advance, it can be very difficult to find it again. Checking on pre-booked rides is not intuitive.",
        "The app sometimes do not show the correct position of the car. (The app is slower then the car.) Anyway, wonderful service, mostly fair prices, correct, nice drivers, clean cars. What else we need? Never I had bad experience with Uber. (Like I had 2 times with the Lift - since I do not use theirs service anymore.) Uber is the right solution for all my trips in the area. -Thank you!",
        "Great app. I have issues sometimes with seeing where drivers are exactly and it appears they don't move for a significant time. I've had to cancel rides after waiting for several minutes and it didn't appear the driver is moving at all. The company should try to remedy this in a way that supports the needs of the rider. I love the ability to call or text the driver if I need.",
        "New review. It used to work wonderfully with my address I've always used. For whatever reason, every time I get a ride now, they always get my location wrong yet, the location I set up for the pickup has always been correct. Really want to get a hold of somebody at Uber to fix the issue, only, in modern times, there's never a phone number to call which is pathetic. Very disappointed in uber."

        "Office is the suite of Microsoft's well known, and most used, applications such as Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Having all of these tools within one app is the best way to work with your files, whether for school, work, home, etc. and be able to move and edit files, while having the ability to easily convert the files when necessary, all within this one \"suite\" app 😀 Amd it really is one sweet app!",
        "Can open and edit office files. However, there is constant syncing issue that would randomly lock files I am working on and then prevent me from editing the file on any device for a long time. And the app doesn't autosave files by default, even files on Onedrive, which is very weird, and there is no way for me to change the default. Finally, the Android app is not as powerful as the web app. I can do a lot more things on the web app, and I almost never had the issues mentioned above.",
        "I regularly use dictation, both on my phone and through other software applications, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking. The microphone in the dictation mode of the Microsoft word office app has been exceedingly accurate thus far, more so than dragon for me. I have a speech impediment and motor impairment, and I find the user interface quite easy to use for manual corrections. I will update as I use it more.",
        "This is the best product Microsoft offers! It is the most efficient, effective way to produce written material, save it, and never lose it! I have been able to retain my writings through multiple devices, they wear out, get old, or even break, but my files are still there, all in one place, easy to print, download and share. I may not like Bill Gate's politics, but I admire Microsoft Office. I highly recommend. carolintallahassee",
        "I suddenly and for a minute find myself with a lot of office projects but not enough to buy the apps yet. And I am beside myself trying to figure out how to do everything LOL. I used to know this stuff but it fell out of my brain. Like making a graph sheet larger is proving to be very difficult and adding a sheet to a folder is impossible but I'll figure it out LOL thank you for having all these apps available. I'm having a lot of fun!"

        "When editing messages, the cursor jumps to the end those messages instead of where the correction is intended. Let's use my first sentence in this review as an example. If I wanted to change the word \"messages\" to say \"text,\" when I start to delete the word \"messages,\" the cursor will jump to the last word of the sentence (i.e., \"intended\") and start deleting that instead. This is VERY frustrating. Need to fix this ASAP!",
        "The new update has caused my videos to not be able to play while scrolling down my news feed. And while scrolling through the video feed under a video. There will be a video presented as a picture above another video. I can only watch every other video. I can't even click on them to see any other information about them. The picture I've attached. I am unable to play the video.",
        "What irritates me the absolute most is that I'll see an ad, such as the FB dating ad or this new stupid survey thing they're doing, and I'll remove it and request to never see it again, yet the next time I open the app, there it is again, regardless of how many times I say to remove it. Insanely annoying. Additionally, when I go to open photos, I see nothing, and have to close and reopen the app and navigate back to where I was to view the photo. There are just a lot of issues going on.",
        "When managing a group you can add photos to albums. While on an iPhone when you click Albums in the group, the albums have no problem loading up. However, on an Android phone or device it keeps giving me a this message (Something went wrong. Please try again.) When clicking the retry button nothing happens most of the time. Eventually they load up after a half hour of reapply clicking the button. This has been an on going issue for quite some time now.",
        "This new update is a little glitchy. When trying to type anything out works fine until I need to go to the middle of the sentence(or back to end) to correct something. It will jump to the end of the sentence or the middle depending on the last place my finger tapped, deleting what I already fixed. I have to click off the keyboard then back on to get it to work. Keyboard works fine on other apps."

        "Great game after you buy it. If this is your first time with the franchise, get the free bloons games. They're great too, but this has mods, custom maps, custom challenges, heroes, and last but not least, it's made in unity, meaning it's a 3d top down game. I'm a sucker for top down games and this is taking it to a whole new level. Now, some criticism. I'd love if you would add a system that allows you to zoom in. Trying to tap a monkey that's in-between 2 monkeys is hell. Thanks for reading",
        "Been a huge fan of bloons since the first one and this one doesn't disappoint! From the new hero's to the new towers to the new ability structure, there are so many improvements and new items it is totally worth the $4.99! After 2 years now of having this game the different events and additional content added make this a game I still love to play with friends. The co-op mode is great to beat challenging levels!",
        "Its a great game, and I love the variety of monkeys and heros you can use! (For the newbies, those are just you fighters basically) the mechanics are pretty simple and its easy to play. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars though is because there is this rare occasional bug that will happen, and it would kick me out of the app and make me restart the map from round 1. Not the best thing to happen, but I still love the game! 🙂",
        "Hello ninja kiwi. I tried logging into another account, but when I attempted to log into my main account, it asked me what save I wanted to play on. Either my main progress, or the new level 2 save. I clicked on level 2 because that's what I wanted to play on, but I didn't realize it was asking me to save that onto my main account. So I lost level 121, black borders, purchases, and every single tower and hero. I also sent you a message about this and never got a response. For now, 1 ⭐",
        "This is truly my favorite game of all time! BTD consistently gets better and better each game and even each upgrade! It is One of the few great games out there that IS NOT a money sucking machine, or a parade of Ad's with a tiny bit of game in between the commercials! Worth every penny and second of time put in!! Thank you for such a fantastic game!"

        "Works, but takes 3-4 seconds to unlock, even with the key fob - and the entire time you have to listen to an irritating tone. We were promised \"Hotel\" style locks - I've stayed in many hotels with mobile locks, and none have been this poor. Stratis and Schalge can do better .... Also, the app should work regardless of whether i have my Jabra earbuds in or not, why am I being recommended to disconnect other Bluetooth devices?",
        "This is ridiculous!!! The app does not work on apartment door. I can get into my building fine but at my apartment door the door lock just flashes red. Then I get a notice to try again. I have changed the batteries THREE times to no avail!! I have downloaded BOTH Stratis apps with the same results. It is very embarrassing to have to go to the office and explain that I can get into the building but not my home.",
        "It has been a month, they haven't been able to set ut up. Update, it took 3 months to get the thermostat working with the app, now my issue is that the app doesn't show my unit. I contacted stratis they made me uninstalled and installed the app 3 times, still my unit is not there. Today i got an email where they told me the same thing i did while on the tech support that didn't fix anything. This app and service is expensive and it doesn't work at all",
        "You cannot control thermostat no matter what. It will only work 1 out if 10 times. The whole purpose of having an app is defeated when you have to get up in middle of the night to change the temp setting.",
        "Finally was able to sign in after numerous errors only to be greeted by the error message: Could not get property attributes Try again. Well I've been trying again and nada. Waste of time & now would not trust it."

        "I liked it better when I could actually rent or buy the movies I wanted in Prime video. Now I'm redirected to Amazon and there's no option to purchase even though it had a price. Unfortunately this has gone the way of Amazon music, overcomplicating something that was simple. Stop making you apps hard to use or you'll lose customers. Ease of use is important. Going to multiple different pages try to accomplish something that literally took the click of a button before is a step backwards.",
        "Really liked the app prior to this most recent update. Have no idea why they make you come out of the app into the site on your browser to search for a movie title all over again just to rent/buy when the previous setup right in the app was so convenient. I'm sure it's going to lead to alot less rentals and purchases just from the unnecessary hassle. Definitely went from better to worse.",
        "The recent update is terrible. I would give zero stars if I could. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and logging out and back in again several times, the app won't recognize that I have amazon prime access so I can't watch any of my shows. Also, making you go to the website to rent movies and not allowing me to watch them from my phone was a terrible move. These changes will cause you to loose my business if it's not fixed.",
        "Certainly enough free movies to make it worthwhile & those that cost $ are reasonably priced for the most part. What I don't like is the fact that once you start watching a film you paid for, you have 48 hours in which to watch, whilst before you start viewing you have 30 days in which to access it. They should just allow you to watch it anytime over the full month period instead of all the different time constraints which are an annoyance. Otherwise in general I have no problems.",
        "When it works, it works well. If you lose Internet access (like watching on a plane), it's not uncommon to have DRM errors in the video you're watching forcing you to skip them. Very annoying! Edit - needing to edit out previous issues to complain about new ones. English description keeps being the default audio track, and resets for each close of the program. Glad I'm at least able to use this on a data connection otherwise I'd have the DRM issue on top of this."

        "Very poor design for exam taking. The submit button is right near the \"next\" button for the next question and I know myself as well as a number of my classmates have accidentally hit the submit button instead of next in the middle of an exam. So we lost points and were not able to retake it. Also, you should be able to go back to previous questions. Poor design.",
        "Not bad! Great for checking grades, getting class announcements, and viewing your progress in the class. Other features often just redirect you to the website, which I don't really mind, except for the fact that the website doesn't support dark mode.",
        "Helps organize my chaos. ALTHOUGH!!! I would really love if it had the option to sync with my Google Calendar 😏 please. I'm using too many different Calendars, all with their own purposes but if everyone could have the option to sync! That would be great. I use my Google calendar more. It would so easier if it could sync vs me having to manually add everything",
        "I would be giving this app a 5 star review if it weren't for the recent hiccups on the app. For the last few days it says I'm not connected to the internet to check my progress in my courses. Edit: Pulse is a great app for online students who are not always near a computer to look that there assignments or grades. I also really like how the calendar shows a \"real time\" graph of what assignments you've completed and when you're done it disappears. It's a nice feeling of accomplishment.",
        "I love the layout of this app. It's easy to use and reliable. I get push notifications for it, so I can see when my assignments are graded, there's an announcement or anything else. After learning how to use D2L on the computer, the app was easy. Granted, I have not used the app to submit anything. I use it as a reference and way to stay up to date. I think computers are better for submissions because I can edit stuff with my preferred programs and use a reliable internet connection for tests."

        "Functional (barely) but buggy. Had to reinstall twice to try to restore full functionality. When trying to edit photos, only a black box shows up instead of seeing the option to save, etc., (because text is black on a black background). When sharing posts from my Facebook feed to a Messenger thread, the shared link won't even open when you try to click on it. The only way to ensure a link will open is to include the URL.",
        "Messenger is a very good place to talk text and video on. I would say 7 out of 10 video/voice calls go through without any issues. There are times that you call your dropped noisy background strange sounds grainy or fuzzy videos. However considering what you're receiving and what you have to pay (nothing ) it's an outstanding service. A lot of things you get you have to pay deer for it and the quality isn't any better. Facebook pushed us to Messenger but it was a smart choice. 4.5 Stars",
        "honestly I'm annoyed. most of the time when someone calls me it doesn't ring, it glitches and won't let me swipe up in a chat, it closes, it takes forever to send pictures or videos etc. the video chat is one of the main problems.. the quality is horrible, most of the time I can't hear the other person, it glitches to watch videos on the video chat, etc. i don't usually do reviews but this is making me mad.",
        "I don't know of a way to send pages or pictures to myself. For awhile, there was a choice to send to myself under \"Just Me,\" but that option has dissppeared from the choices under \"Send To.\" Also I would like the option to send a message under SMS. Also this window of \"Rate this app\" keeps freezing up so I cannot answer the provided questions. Horrible.",
        "Since I can't find patch notes, I'm going to throw this out there. Facebook, fix your app. Every time I switch from my Page's messages to my personal messages, the app soft locks and I have to clear the cache and restart my phone. Maybe if you spent a bit less time and effort spying on people and a bit more time keeping up on maintenance, it'd run better."

        "I have used Lithium Pro for years and read 100s of books with it. I have and at times used other readers, but Lithium is my go-to day in and day out. It is rock solid. It's configurability is not as extensive as some others, but the configurability available is perfectly chosen and easily accessed. This is important as I read in different environments so quickly adjusting font intensity or background color is very useful - I do such frequently. Lithium is the most usable reader I've found!",
        "Great E-PUB reader app, solid and intuitive interface. If I had a gripe, it would be that there could be a bit more categorizing options. Being able to edit the book flags. Example: sorting by author name, but some book files have first and last name reversed. This throws of the sorting order. (Brooks, Terry versus Terry Brooks)",
        "It's been years but I keep coming back to this app over others. Recently, I was tired of the limited functionality from the free version of Lithium, such as the inability to change the font type and themes. So, I went searching for a suitable alternative and installed several alternatives. Every one of them felt bloated and glitchy, some of them even suspiciously creepy. Therefore, I'm a returning user of Lithium until someone decides to make a better free reader app like calibre for desktop.",
        "Excellent app. Found my books immediately. I gave this four stars for two reasons. First, the book contents, etc. are on the RIGHT side. When turning pages, you can get that information, which distracts from reading. Second, no dictionary. The pages turn beautifully, except when you get the table of contents by mistake. Taking notes is a breeze, and it appears that copying selected text - for insertion into a school paper, for example, is available, but I did not test it. I really wish there was a dictionary option. Leaving your reading to look up a word - might as well be reading a \"real\" book. Otherwise, I really like this app for reading epub.",
        "Very good! This is an excellent quality e-reader and it's got a nice minimalist interface that doesn't get in the way. I use the Pro version, but it's still missing the single feature that I need most: Backup of epub files to Google Drive. The problem is that a lost phone is still something of a disaster when there's no backup of the epub's themselves. The only other thing it needs badly is background preloading of the next page. Otherwise, it's an excellent reader. Much better than 90% of what's out there."

      "comments": [
        "This latest update 1.7.85.25 is completely horrible. They removed one of the best features the app had. The ability to quick change output from the notification bar. I do not want to have to go to to the media output button. The quick access was so much easier and more convenient to use... I will be rolling back to a previous version.",
        "The volume control could be way more responsive than it is. I shouldn't have to wait nearly a full second for every 1 unit of volume increase/decrease. Maybe introduce a press & hold option. Otherwise this app is great. I have 2 Q80A's in the same room and that makes the remotes worthless unless you intend both TVs to respond to each individual command. The Smart Things app keeps us from killing each other. I was told the remotes are Bluetooth but I can only get IR responses out of them.",
        "It's overly complicated and unreliable. Does work well with our Frame TV. Sometimes it won't connect so we can't turn the TV on. You would think it would be easier to navigate to Netflix or Hulu via the app, but all it is is a digital version of the remote. Have fun entering passwords by swiping on a touchpad to select letter by letter on your TV. It could be so much better.",
        "It literally only worked for about 5 minutes. I got this app to use with my new Samsung smart TV. After setting everything up on the TV & my phone, the remote control functions worked great... until the first time I closed the app. Nothing on the app has worked since. I can see my devices, but I can't interact with them at all. In fact, I can't interact with much of anything in the app now. All I can do is look at stuff. I can't change or even click on almost anything. Absolute garbage app.",
        "The only time I have a use for the SmartThings app is to get help finding my watch. But the feature needs a download within the app (which in itself is annoying) but no matter how many times I tap on the Find card the add-on never downloads. No errors or any other indication of what's wrong. For a feature that is normally needed in an urgency to be a useless tile in the app is just horrible product design."

You’ll also see your three most recent DMs in the Home tab for added convenience.<br>Bug Fixes<br>• Fixed: Images and videos were not displaying any sort of preview, an experience some found “mysterious and exciting” and everyone else found “broken and annoying.”",

        "Pretty robust and includes almost all features as the desktop app. Only one I can't think of at the moment is adding a custom emoji, which doesn't affect my daily work. Overall slack is good. I wish they supported video calls. I like being able to set different notifications for my mobile device vs my desktop. The search function is great too. It does take 5-10 minutes for me to upload a photo and the preview show up. But overall it's a 5/5.",
        "I am writing this in hopes that someone from the developing team views this message about a suggested change I have in regards to using the mobile app. When viewing messages inside a channel on the mobile app, if a member is currently typing, Slack will notify you with a recurring message at the bottom of the chat stating \"${member-name} is typing...\". This notification message is recurring until the member finishes typing. The problem with this feature in the mobile app is every time this notification message recurs it shifts all messages in the channel up slightly to make room for the notification message to be displayed. When the notification message temporarily disappears it shifts all messages back down. The continual shifting up and down anytime another member is typing makes reading the other messages in the channel very difficult and unpleasant. This is a great app, I use it for both work and personal use. Thank you to all the developers that have made the overall experience so good. I hope this review reaches the right team(s) and this isolated yet impactful issue is resolved.",
        "It is not possible to login on the Android app. Password reset doesn't work. The magic link fails. Sign in manually fails. It just crashes or goes in a circle of signing in. I've tried different usernames and invites. Force closing. Different phones. The workspace available sometimes disappears. I have no idea but it has a serious malfunction that makes it useless. We quit using it as a company.",
        "The Android app is decent but pales in comparison to the desktop application. The app sometimes enters a state where it is impossible to change workspaces without restarting the app. And also sometimes will not recognize what a message has already been read, leaving you with a notification badge that you cannot get rid of of.",
        "Update for 3-30-22 Was actually going to rate the app higher than my original review as September 2021 through January 2022 were mostly without incident and the app functioned as intended. The last 2 weeks however have completely removed that built up goodwill. Right back to it's old ways of deleting photos in the cache, kicking you out of keyboard and speak to text UI's, and consuming battery too quickly. I hate it. It has been detrimental to my work."

Have installed another calculator app from play store until Samsung fixes this issue. So stupid of the developers, if it ain't broke don't fix it!!",
        "Update Edit: 5 stars now since they removed the inputing click/sounds. Its the best and perfect calculator app. Thank you!! Nice, clean and easy to use calculator with ZERO ads. If I could make a recommendation, is give users the ability to turn off (or vibrate only) the input clicks when typing a number. Other than that, the app is the best Ive ever used.",
        "Edited back to 5 stars April 30, 2022. Thank you for removing the sounds that the last update added. They truly were horrible, especially with no way to turn them off. Everything seems to be back to normal (quiet), and I appreciate it!! Dec. 2021: New update added sound that NOBODY wants. Remove the sounds or add an option to turn them off. Ridiculous that an app doesn't have an option to turn the sounds off.",
        "The app remains 1 star. To start with, Calctastic is better in every way. Despite them finally removing the click sound almost everyone hated, it took far too long to fix, and the idiocy of forcing it in the first place destroys confidence in their ability to make intelligent design choices. Why risk their incompetent when you can use Calctastic? Ditch the Samsung calculator for something that won't be stupidly modified. Never this calculator again. Calctastic is the way to go.",
        "Installed the app (version 12.1.10.8) on my galaxy tab s6. Very poor design. Does \"engineering calculator icon\" refer to the few basic algebra and trig functions on the left? No such single icon exists, nor does a \"science\" icon. From the other reviews : (1) app follows device theme only. (2) clicking sounds only controlled by the system sound setting, no independent control. Why all the critical reviews about the button click sound? I prefer touch sounds. As for the app, uninstalled."

        "It's awesome to know that I can run some diagnostic tests on key elements. However, it does not read USB connection, I had to fill in the blue dots for proximity with my finger since my swipes weren't enough. There is no headphone port available for the Z Flip 3 5G. I do not own a wireless charger. So the final rating will not be 100% Perhaps you could provide an option saying 'not owned' or 'not included'.",
        "Worthless app. The bug reporting does nothing, you can write out a novel on what the issue is, steps to reproduce, screenshots and screen recordings, include logs and everything that is required and you'll still get a response back, \"We need more information.\" All this is a \"feel good\" measure for people to actually think that Samsung cares when it's just a bot reading them and kicking them back. Better off talking to a wall.",
        "Not having issues with my phone currently, but having the ability to test each of its functions is amazing, something I couldn't do with my previous phone (not Samsung). It helps to pinpoint if there's an actual problem or if you just need to restart your phone, which is necessary to do so every now and then to keep it stable. Great app, great functionality. 10/10 recommend.",
        "My overall review and rating is subject to change based on if I'm able to contact anyone from the Samsung Members team. It is not easy to find any contact information, the messaging feature is useless because the app is not recognized as a product, and no one has any information when calling the regular customer service number (not their fault as the teams are most likely completely seperate).",
        "The one thing I'm having problems with and the test makes no sense. Tells me to tap record and there nothing on the screen that says record. Is it the microphone symbol??? Then why don't you say so. My lower mic isn't working. That's all the app gives me is that it's not work. I already know that. Useful diagnosis would be to tell me that it's hardware issue or software or an app setting causing a conflict. Near useless."

        "I used to love this app. It was great to track exercise, heart rate, oxygen levels. Just upgraded from the s9 to the s22 and was extremely disappointed that Samsung removed the pulse/oxygen monitor. The stress measuring was also awesome to have especially for someone with anxiety problems. Now they're trying to make you buy a watch to get these features. I was considering getting the watch but now I absolutely won't do that.",
        "I've found the app extremely useful for tracking my workouts and food up until a recent update. I'm not sure if there is a glitch or a problem they're working to fix, but the steps counter on the app won't finish loading and you can't even use the food tracker anymore. You can look up the food, but when you try to add portion size it doesn't let you almost as if the update was unfinished when added. Please fix this as it's one of the key features of your app.",
        "A year ago I'd have given this app 5-star review. It tracked my steps better than my FitBit and I absolutely loved the stress monitor. However, I have not been able to use the stress monitor, which was my favorite feature, since October 2021. I have not changed phones in that time, only done \"upgrades\". I'm actually relieved to see others are having the same issue and it's not me or my phone.",
        "The timer in the swimming app does not stop when the button is pushed. You have to expel the water first, then if you have completed your preset laps, a flag is displayed, then your stats show up. All this takes place before you can swipe right to stop the timer. Your final time includes all of the above rather than just your swim time. Please fix. It has been this way for along time.",
        "I use this for hiking and biking. Sometimes when I'm going up a steep hill going slow, the app pauses. This get annoying. Another thing is sometimes when I finish my workout, I forget to turn off the app. I will drive home and the app records all that driving as part of the workout. It ruins all my stats. And there's no way to edit the workout. The app should be able to tell if you are driving vs walking, no one can walk or bike 60 mph"

It eventually does appear, but the amount of time it takes makes me worry every time. There are a few glitches like this that I am hoping will be fixed in the future. In addition, I had problems with customer service when I had an issue. Edit: now I can't send cute gifs when I send money. Very disappointed.",

They responded (great customer service) and the search feature has finally been added, and it's exactly what I was looking for. 5 stars. 2ND EDIT 2022: What the heck! They got rid of the gifs! That was one of the best parts of the app. Idc if this is petty or not, but I love the cute animations. Dropping back down to 2 stars because of the change. Please bring something back, even if they're different images. So boring otherwise...",
        "App is unusable. I cannot transfer or send any money from my Venmo balanace. Presumably this is because I need to verify my identity, but the option to verify my identity went missing from the settings. Not only that, I've been getting errors when trying to verify my identity for the past month. I've reinstalled multiple times, this is ridiculous.",
        "New toggle button for payment is confusing. It makes it look like you have to switch it on to make a payment, when switching it on actually turns it into a payment for goods or services and charges the other person a fee. I have two payments to friends that I'm now trying to cancel because that button was misleading.",
        "The balance is never accurate. It does not update when a transaction is made. They make free transfers (1-3 business days) as difficult as possible but instant transfers that take 2% of your transfer amount really easy. If you want your transactions private; you have to select private every time you open the app. I think it defaults to share (publicly) your transactions...I have no idea why thats even a feature to begin with. The app relies on inaccuracies, to skim money from your bank. Trash!"

        "Nicely designed with many useful features, but be careful of the translations. It will often translate sentences incorrectly, but if you tap \"reverse translate\" you can usually weed out the bad answers. It is nicely complemented by Microsoft Translator. It works best with the major languages. If you use Gboard, the layout will change to match the input language in Translate!",
        "It's good for text, but slow. It doesn't pick up audio or anything majority of the time unless it's completely quiet in the room except for who's talking, even after you've downloaded a language to use offline. The audio just doesn't work usually. Overall it's not good when you need a quick translation to help with customers if you need to use it for that.",
        "My wife have relied heavily on Google Translate for 5 years as expats living in Central and South America. English-Spanish translations were fast and effortless with text and voice modes, though the character recognition feature was a little clumsy. It was a true workhorse we used multiple times everyday. The last week of May 2022, a new version was installed that brought the app to a dead standstill. Now all I get is error messages. As a retired IT professional I wonder about the test process.",
        "Occasionally, it tells me it can't translate because it's offline, even when I'm connected to the internet. I verified I was connected by using the browser version. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling, but the issue still occurs periodically. It does work offline with downloaded languages, but only after turning on airplane mode.",
        "As others have mentioned, the latest redesign has come with many usability regressions as well as bugs. Reverse translation is very difficult to find now. The app often refuses to translate for me, claiming to be offline. This happens even when I have a language downloaded AND am online. When I go to manage my downloaded languages, the app consistently crashes. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app to no avail. The team behind this update should be pretty embarrassed by their bad work."

      "comments": [
        "In the last week, the app has been kicking me off every few hours. I uninstall it, restart my phone and install it again and yet, the same thing happens - the app will not allow me to sign in. It says \"unknown error. Please try again\". If you do business on LinkedIn and use this app for convenience, while traveling, etc, I would be cautious and have a good back up plan in place. The app has become unreliable and unstable. I wish they could resolve this issue.",
        "More bugs than a cheap motel. I've been an avid user of LinkedIn for years. I keep avoiding the app because 1.) It's always been a data hog 2.) 9 outta 10 times it has a glitch of some sort. I just DL'd it today hoping it was better. Nope! The prompt came up for dark mode. I closed it. I don't want dark mode. The app went into dark mode anyway. I'm trying to access the settings to turn off auto-play (data hog) but it's a blank screen. Literally nothing there. I'll stick with the website. 🙄",
        "LinkedIn makes working with your settings very difficult. The app is not intuitive at all. This app is almost as bad as the desktop version. I also noticed that the app and desktop versions don't sync up. My profile picture and experiences are different on the app and desktop versions. Very disorganized and not clean.",
        "Fails to access app when reading emails. Recently the app has not been as good as in the past. It looks Cvs up when I receive an email from LinkedIn. When I tap on the link it says I should \"use the LinkedIn app.\" Then tries to load LinkedIn as if it's brand new. Very frustrating. Even after reloading it fails to recognize that it's loaded. Tried erasing and reloading but doesn't fix the problem. Gotta fix this!!!",
        "Good app but it is better on a computer. I have no idea how it may have worked on my old Note 5 that I was using until 2020. We also lived in a very rural area in the mountains where just keeping the electricity on and navigating through downed trees (and power poles) could be a challenge. So far where I currently live this works well (until the power is out)."

        "It's not intuitive, and the help feature didn't prove to be of any use. I had to read through reviews on the play store to figure out how to access accounts that weren't credit cards - session ticket membership and covid vaccine. It turns out you can access them by clicking on the center bar up top, which says \"set up contactless\", and gives no indication that is an access point.",
        "Why is the wallet part of this so inaccessible? It's a tiny button way at the top of the screen! But if you want to link your accounts to give Google more data or see a page of deals (ads!), then rest assured those are quite easy to access. Absolute failure of design. When I open my wallet, I want to see my cards, not a bunch of receipts. That should be secondary. And the ads? Seriously? If they have to be there, put them further out of the way. That shouldn't be a primary option.",
        "The functionality of this app is great but it took me far too long to find where the hell it keeps virtual tickets (pro-tip, it's the white bar at the top of the screen). Very unintuitive design. Right now, the targeted ads, sponsors, etc take center stage at the bottom of the screen, but I'm pretty sure most people only care about the cards and tickets.",
        "It just won't work randomly. The whole point of it - and it just stops working. I went out with just my phone to the grocery store (where I used the same method before) and it doesn't read. The main tip is to uninstall and install again - as if the makers aren't familiar with technology and expects ppl to troubleshoot in line at the grocery store register with no WiFi. Nice. Wasted time, UNRELIABLE. Use as last resort and hope it'll work. UX/UI navigation got better though.",
        "Updated review because after a year things have improved. The main page when you log in was rearranged, so the basic functions are right up top. Also, your default card is activated and can scan from this page without having to open the wallet. I would still prefer if the wallet view could be made the default page. The first iteration of the new app there were ads prominently displayed and intermixed on each page, but things have been reorganized to make the primary functions more prominent."

        "Frequent changes to app are annoying. Several times I've gone to purchase something with the app while in line and the changes were disruptive, causing delay and requiring me to eventually just have to use my physical card. I won't really consider this app good until I can leave my wallet home and use this app alone. Best feature of the app is that it doesn't require NFC and can be used with older POS terminals.",
        "I would love to use Samsung pay but I cant stand the constant pop ups and banner ads trying to sell me deals on credit cards. The UI is cluttered and the user experience is annoying AF. I have all ad options turned off in the settings menu yet there are still tons of ads. And they dont support Mastercard which is the card I use 90% of the time. Also, it would be nice if I could edit the name of each card in my profile (food, personal expenditures, ect).",
        "It works great on my Note 20 Ultra again. After the February 2022 update, had to follow advice from another user to make it stop turning the credit cards just briefly after fingerprinting - not long enough to complete a transaction. His advice is to open the app, go to settings, tap on reset app. It worked! My prior Samsung rewards card automatically populated with the same $ balance. My membership card populated as well. Had to add back credit cards and reactivate them. Still enjoying it!",
        "Doesn't work on my galaxy s22+. I never had a problem on my old phone, but I can't get past the opening page, when I click \"get started\", the icon spins and then stops, and I clock get stated again, same thing. If I can't use the app then it's worthless to keep on the phone. Was good when it worked",
        "I have tried several times to use this app. I have updated and installed numerous times. Cleared out cache data. I'm very unhappy. I have sent several emails and messages to customer support about the problem. Even tried troubleshooting it on the web. Nothing worked. If I could completely Uninstall the app, I would!"

        "I like it! they allow the option to easily adjust the aspect ratio, brightness, and volume. The layout is very nice and matches with my dark mode. The videos stream very well and the ads are very tolerable from what were used to with other services. I also like to option to be reminded when a show or movie is about to come on that you want to see. Thanks samsung the comunity need this one!",
        "I like the Samsung app. However what I have a problem with the free apps from streaming platforms say that they have local channels and you are not able to find the ones for your city or they are all news stations that do not have full access to the whole content. It's either 1 or 2 mins of a story then it goes to something totally different. When you say local channels make it relevant to the zip code that that person is using.",
        "OK, I got the dead screen like everyone else but rather than closing the app I let it run for a while and didn't pay attention to it it then suddenly the agreements showed up. You know where you give away all your data. Anyway, I did a one star review and it got taken down. 🤔 The app works, it has a ton of channels too. Most of which I'll never watch hit that's personal preference. Have it as a backup on the go. My son enjoyed it on a road trip so that's a win in my book.",
        "Great app! Unfortunately and sadly I spoke too soon. The ads are really starting to pour in now and most are so repetitious that it makes me want to turn Samsung TV off. Please don't become Roku! Don't become another ad Warehouse this app has potential. Whether it's for free or not , try to make it worth using. Way too many ads! I just counted 28 ads in 20 minutes! That's ridiculous! This app went downhill fast!",
        "Edit: Works in Hawaii and does not require GPS. Does not need Chromecast support, works with all Roku and Firestick devices. Review: One of my favorite apps right now. I love classic game shows. This is the best way to view them for free and one of the best ways to view them in general. Great video quality and normal amount of commercials, plus the ability to save favorite channels. I love it!"

        "I heavily rely on the notes app, and I have few complaints! I wish there were more bullet point options and that we could \"tab\" in to create more of a tree structure, like using bullet points in Microsoft Word. Also it bugs me a little that when you search for a word, open a note and write in it, when you hit \"back\" it goes back to the search; i selected a note and wrote in it, I already found what I was looking for :)",
        "My favorite thing about this app is that it automatically saves...you can put in a message and not have to take that extra step. With all previous notes apps I've used before, you had to click the 'Save' button and some of them also required you to save it to a folder as a pdf so you had to find the folder, etc. This has a Save option, but it's not required. Great app and simple to use.",
        "Funny thing is the ratings are always in a hurry so this is a reflection of my first impressions which may change after some longer use. I like the interface and the multiple folders that can be created. But I'm using it to begin with as a groceries list and secondary items list. So far so good👍",
        "I am an artist and writer. I use Samsung notes everyday, all day. It gives me enough space to jot down amy ideas I have for my next project. I can Sketch with a variety of mediums. It gives me access to great colors. The templates are all very useful and helps me stay organized! I am still learning, but so far Samsung notes gets 10/10 from me!!",
        "This is a simple, but effective note app. I use it for everything from grocery lists to taking notes in diving classes. The list function is my favorite; being able to check off items is very handy. Just discovered the ability to add pictures to my notes, which is an awesome feature."

It's a bit less intuitive to create assignments on the app, but moving them around and doing small edits works just fine.",
        "The app is terrible. I would taste it a 2 out of five except that the mobile version of the web app is so much better. Every change from what they already have is inconvenient. Why did you turn date selection into a series of individual pieces instead of the convenient calendar? Why remove the option for automation? Why didn't you make any change the display to fit a vertically oriented screen? I experienced second hand embarrassment trying to use this thing. I am uninstalling now.",
        "Limited compared to the desktop. I know that the phone app probably wouldn't have all the features the desktop has but the phone has barely anything. There is NO automation and you can't make or use templates. You can essentially JUST add cards, can't even use power up. Really just good for viewing information.",
        "Horrible since the changeover. Power ups don't show up in mobile app, all the stuff we previously used that was free is now being taken away and only usable in premium version which for a family to use is too expensive for each family member to have premium. I have to find another way/app to replace this one because the change over to Atlassian has made the user experience difficult to use and expensive. Plus it's always breaking down now and having issues. Miss the old Trello.",
        "I really like Trello for keeping track of the many aspects of my rather busy life. However there a few improvements I would love to see implemented. I would really like to have cards be repeatable. For example, I have a card for something I want to do each week. I also want to keep track on when it was done. However, if I create multiple cards for the task, I can't keep track of when it was done. If I change the due date to the next occurance, I again can't keep track that it was done, unless I add notes. I'd like to have cards that I could repeat at specific durations (daily, weekly, monthly, etc) that I could check off each time it was completed to track it. Also, I wish the calendar would show all of my boards on one calendar or that I could pick and choose which boards to show on the calendar rather than only one board being visible."

        "Samsung Switch is awesome! I've had a new Samsung for a while but have had a deep fear of the change. Had so much on my old phone that I didn't want to lose. Finally decided to bite the bullet after reading about this app, although I was very skeptical. Oh my!! I used the WiFi option. It did take a little over an hour but when I opened the new phone....IT LOOKED JUST LIKE THE OLD ONE!! All my apps, pics, games; etc...were not only there but in the same place. Just awesome!!",
        "Phone to phone transfer does a fair job. It will basically clone the new (receiving) phone. But keep in mind, if the old phone had any problem apps (or other issues) the new phone will inherit those as well. Using this app to make a back-up via usb-c flash drive has a big limitation. To Restore that backup, the options are, all or nothing, (useless). Unlike a phone to phone transfer where you can pick and choose what you want to send and receive.",
        "I'm really disappointed in this app and do not recommend it. I used it recently to transfer all data from my my Galaxy Note 10+ to a new S22 Ultra. The process seemed to go just fine, and there were no errors. However, I discovered later that several apps and settings did not transfer to my new phone, which caused me to spend a lot of time figuring out what happened. For instance, I use and previously paid for multi instances of the Time Recording Pro (TRP) app. After the SS transfer, the TRP app no longer recognized my payment. After writing the TRP developer, I learned that Smart Switch did not transfer the required DynamicG utility plugin app that monitors the multi instance license, and I had to manually install it from the Play Store.",
        "Absolute waist of time! I've been using smart switch for 5 years! I've never had an issue with it until now. My wifi is perfectly fine. It connects to everything else just fine, but it WILL not connect with this app. I've been trying to connect with wifi for 2 hours now! PLEASE DO NOT download this app!!!! It will just aggravate you!",
        "I'm changing my review. Everything that I thought hadn't transferred, actually transferred without issue. It just took a while and each app had to be automatically reinstalled after the initial process had completed. I started with a new phone and one with maxed out storage so it taking a while was expected. The entire process was over 4 hours, but that includes various updates and such.. overall it was a good experience and the app worked perfectly. Thank you."

      "comments": [
        "Useful, if it wasn't for the fact that it allows you to pay twice for the same vehicle at a specific time in the exact same area .. It happens very frequently. I try to pay, the app doesn't show the payment went through. So I think I did something wrong, and choose the time and pay. Finally the second time I pay it shows two \"activities \" in my profile. I contacted the app assist.and they said it's not they responsibility. Who takes that money? It shouldn't allow two exact payments.",
        "This app works ok. It just forces ads on you in an intrusive way (eg blocking the pay for parking button until you click their offer and then you can return to the app and actually pay for the parking session -its happened two times so far). Also the setting for turning off an email reminder for the end of a parking session does not actually stop it from sending an email notification. :/ Otherwise, it works.",
        "Exactly what I needed and great UI. Love being able to set a default car and parking space because I always park in the same ramp with the same car. Love the map it shows of the different parking areas. Just a few clicks to park and pay. I use PayPal and it works seamlessly. Plus you can extend your time from the app and it won't let you select more time than what the parking ramp charges for i.e. can't if it's 4PM and ramp is free after 6PM, it only lets me buy up to 2 hrs so I don't overpay",
        "OK functionally, suboptimal design. It mostly does what it says. But, it's schizophrenic about what timing options it offers. There are many street parking spaces where the physical meter let's you prepay the specified amount of time, but this app forces you to start an indefinite timer where you pay after you explicitly \"end parking\". Of course, you then forget to do that and get charged to park all day. Sometimes, it fails to show zones on the built-in map. The notifications are not accurate. If you stop/cancel your parking in the middle of the day, you still get notifications at 8pm or whenever that zone would have expired.",
        "This is a terrible app. I registered under my Google account and then it doesn't give the option to log back in under Google. It emailed me notification that my meter expired and there was no link in the email to reconnect and pay for additional time. I went into the app and it showed no activity which is why I logged out and tried to re-log back in. In both cases it did not allow me to access the parking location even when it was on the map. This may be the worst app I ever used! I deleted it."

        "This app always gives me issues. I am able to book my appointment HOWEVER finding a business to book with is always an issue. When I open the app it tells me to provide a location which the app is has location permissions and then when I try to search a business I get an error message saying no location found after I put in a location. Even clicking on the types of services gives me an error message. Definitely not worth the space on my phone.",
        "Not user friendly The app is glitchy, constantly requires refreshing. There is no \"calendar view\" for scheduled appointments and the list view is difficult to read because there is too much info in each appointment listing (like the venue's photo, which shouldn't be appearing with every scheduled appointment). Scheduling repeat appointments is also confusing. All in all, it just feels like this app isn't concerned with ease-of-use or intuitiveness.",
        "First off, it worked perfectly fine. Then outta nowhere when I tried to check if my request for an appointment has been accepted, it keeps telling me \"Oops!

        "Used to be a really great app. I loved using it to book my hair appointments and tattoos. Now I can't even get it to fully load when I open it. Nothing shows up on my screen and I can't book appointments. I can't rven see local businesses. I don't know if the newest patch accidentally caused a bug or something but it's really annoying. I hope it gets corrected soon.",
        "This app does not perform well over WiFi or in areas with poor cell signal; which is a majority of what I have access to. This causes the app to be slow and clunky. Upon reporting the issue I was told it's because I don't have enough service - which I can't control. Fortunately my providers have left salons that use this app and I no longer have to struggle with performance quality."

        "I've been using Google home for the past several years now. It used to be, that on my speaker group, I can control individual speaker volume and I can also control the group's volume - which is very important to me and very convenient. Now, Google Home don't have those anymore. I have to go to individual speakers to control their volume. As you might know, songs are recorded at different volume levels and sometimes, you have to adjust the volume depending on how they're recorded (not everytime though) and the single control on the Group's volume is very convenient and very smart....who tf in his infinite wisdom, decided to delete that feature....it's like the guy who rejected the Beatles, because according to him, they sounded just like any other band... bring that feature back please.",
        "Fine until it lost everything. Again. The issue is I have set up my home multiple times. The latest time it lost all 5 of my speakers but not one of the chromecasts. Now I have to go and resetup everything again, but I'll have to factory reset my speakers to get home to see them on the same wireless network. And sadly it has happened twice before. The app works fine when things can be seen. I just wish they'd move profiles somewhere easier to recover. Or even provide a backup function.",
        "Setting up Chromecast devices is a pain. I seem to have to redo it every six months or so, and it's a steep learning curve every time. I did end up resetting it (thank you to Dev for the suggestion, but I did that anyway) and then it was even more headscratching trying to figure out the setup steps. For it working on the end. Took 20 minutes I would rather have spent watching YouTube. (Dev, thanks for the link, I may need it again six months from now when I have to set up again.)",
        "Awful. Keep having to factory reset and go through the setup process. Once that's done, my devices can see the chromecast is there, but can never connect. Useless. Edit: yes, Google LLC, the router and my devices are all compatible and set up accordingly. They've been reset and all that stuff. Nothing. I go through the setup process smoothly. Afterwards the app suddenly has no idea where the chromecast is. Can do that all day. Other apps recognize the chromecast. Home app is just bad.",
        "It's pretty impressive what you can do with this app. You can manage all the devices in your home and all Google Assistant settings. It's a bit overwhelming though. It's not organized very well and it doesn't provide notifications or have Android home screen widgets. Passive users will have a hard time getting the most out of it without diving deep into the settings."

        "The hardware is great. The software... These things will interrupt your media at every opportunity to try and get you to enable notifications. So I have notifications disabled and yet everytime I get a text message the Pixel Buds interrupt what I am doing to remind me that I can enable notifications. The stupidity on display in some of these design choices is staggering.",
        "Sounds like you all broke it. Ever since my phone updated, the pixel buds won't stay connected once they're taken out of the case and no audio comes through them. I've done all the trouble shooting tips and still NOTHING. I'm not usually one to write reviews but this is disappointing. I expect the buds that come with the phone to work with the phone.",
        "The app forgets your sound settings. The settings appear the same when you return to the app to find out what is going on, and if you undo/redo the settings when your buds are connected, you get the sound settings you originally made. Pretty poor. Glad I got these for free with the pixel 6. Edit: Forgot to mention, I can't find the app any more; it no longer appears in either the list of apps or home screen. Same as other reviewers. I can only access the app by going into the play store app, searching for it and opening it from there. Hard to believe this is what counts as a full public release when they own all the platforms involved (buds, phone and software).",
        "More recent firmware upgrade has ruined what was working perfectly fine. Now I only hear some 90% of meetings and music they cut out so much. Also, super annoying whenever I go to open the \"app\" I find it nearly impossible to find/open it. You should really make it an app in the app drawer that allows you to reach settings in a sensible way. Also, please fix all the cutouts!",
        "Honestly they should have worked on these a lot more before pushing them out. I got them when they came out. Ever since I get nothing but issues at least once a week. One ear will play louder than the other at times. If it randomly disconnects (which happens a lot) I click forget and it takes like 10 mins for me to reconnect it cuz it doesn't pop up. One dies 10x quicker than the other.The charging goes on and off, having to change the positions.These are over priced for a not good product."

        "I own the 25c vacuum, it started out awesome and worked great. Now I have to reconnect it to my internet about every 2 days and most times it says connection failed. I have reset wifi, other smart devices do not have any trouble. Will be switching to a roomba if this continues. It is very disappointing seeing this unit comes at a affordable price and over all works great. But I purchased so it will clean daily when I am away, your customers support is also horrible, let us speak to a real tech.",
        "Good overall. Just got the X8 that has the laser mapping and it is a trip to watch it go around and make the map. Also it does a great job with vacuuming. If I had more hard flooring or tile I probably would have sprung for the hybrid model that does mopping as well.",
        "The smart plugs always have problems setting up schedules and timers. When you try to make a change in the app, it says \"device is currently not connected to the internet\" which is totally wrong because I can still turn the plug on and off manually with the app... I just can't tell it to turn on/off the plug at a certain time. Some plugs work fine. Some don't. Some work after deleting the plug and re-adding it, some don't, and some work fine and then decide to stop accepting changes after a bit",
        "Everytime I try to connect my vacuum to my network it fails. Every single time. And it can't tell me why it fails. It goes through the connecting part, gets to 100%, then fails. Gives generic responses list like password might be incorrect (it's not, but also it gets to 100% with an incorrect network password?), it states that it can only connect to 2.4 ghz WiFi (which my network is).",
        "Works Okay. I find that the robot has no issues connecting to WIFI. Robot does a good job at vacuuming. However, the apps realtime update of robot position and status seems to lag or not show up correctly. It seems everytime i move the robot it needs to re-learn the space. Preventing me from sending it off to a certain room. App could use some work"

        "Complete garbage. How do you screw up a notes app? No keyboard support. Up and down arrows won't go between list items, and backspace won't delete empty items. It won't show me all lists with a particular tag. I got the Galaxy Watch 4 for so I could use Google apps on my watch. Too bad when I open this app on my watch it just says \"Notes syncing...\". The web version is terrible. It won't let me drag and scroll up, so if something is at the bottom of a long list I can't put it at the top.",
        "I'm a little upset that it doesn't show the date that I created the note like how Samsung Notes does, it only has when I last edited the note. Also, when I try to change the color of the font, it only let's me change the background color of the note. Please add this feature! It's helpful so I can emphasize words or phrases. As well as zooming in/out of the screen, that used to be very helpful when I was using Samsung Notes. I could take a screenshot of my notes all in one go.",
        "It doesnt sync across platforms, I lost important notes because they didn't show up on my pc when I put them in on my phone. I tried to resintall the app and it's been loading my notes and still nothing. The collaborators feature just stopped working, my collaborators can't see the notes anymore even after updating and refreshing. It's just lowsy and unreliable. I'm over it. I'm better off using my Samsung notes.",
        "Good God I love this app. I use it constantly, mainly for note taking but I've shifted to using it for reminders as well. I only wish it were Integrated better into the Pixel and Google ecosystem. Both Calendar and the Assistant have their own tasks/reminders implementation separate from this. I like using everything in Keep, but I wish the other two services fully synced what I do here. Custom colors on labels would be nice. Syncing Pixel Recorder entries into their own notes automatically, too",
        "Needs better search. Overall a good straightforward note keeper across devices. But without the ability to search within a note - and show the found location - it's not actually usable for me. Not every note is a one-sentence jot; also multi-page rosters, vocab lists, meeting notes, etc., and just finding the note is not enough."

You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n\nEnroll in our beta program!

        "So long as you are operating it on a newer device or one with enough ram to move quickly, it's very nice. Otherwise it'll move slowly and you might even have to have it open to recieve notifications (tested on various phones). But as the devices were cheap, it was to be expected - you get what you pay for. Love the app, would love to see the security coding as I am studying such topics in college right now.",
        "Really good app. I must admit, I was a bit nervous saving such information at first, but honestly? You really can't trust anyone BUT Microsoft for this kind of thing. You can save passwords, debit/ credit cards, even use it for Multi-Factor Authentication (the best I've ever used, and I used them all). On top of all that, it gives you the option to autofill that information on any text box that supports it (yes, that's the website that has to support it, not this app)",
        "This is the worst. The app and my laptop aren't communicating like they need to, it no longer gives me a QR code, and keeps sending the same message to both screens. Seriously, how am I supposed to see a code or accept something if both screens are requesting the same data, but neither is showing anything but that message.... at least until it times out.",
        "I'm giving this app 5 stars even though, at the present time, it's not working quite right for me. It started out always auto filling passwords, but now it doesn't the majority of the time & I'm always having to back out of what I'm doing & look up a password... which is probably not the app's fault, but something to do with my settings. I've been round & round in the settings, but I can't seem to be able to find the \"magic key\" that will make everything work right again....*sigh*",
        "Works as described... I have had problems with other authenticor apps I've tried l maybe 3 or 4 other apps which sometimes can get me confused. I have several accounts with Google & Outlook ect. This one is pretty easy to use & works great everytime, especially when I need to sign into my laptop it just sends the verification to my cell-I click the button and it works just like it's supposed to! Thanks developers! Keep up the good work 🙂"

        "App forced removal from my Android phone - no explanation - just wont work. We love the airline - top marks in almost everything they do - but to kill an app - which basically now requires us to print boarding passes and check in by computer is not only not smart - but a great way to get me to explore other airline options. Come on team - fix this, or at least provide a quick easy way to transfer the data from a computer to your cell phone for flights.",
        "Why design an app that eliminates 70% of your customers. I have four Android devices and this app does not work on three of them. Poor decision by the development team. App does work with some glitches on the device that the app is available. Have not been on a single flight where the app does not crash during a movie. Better than nothing, but could be drastically improved.",
        "Update: 2022...I had 2 separate accounts and the operator was extremely patient with me getting that information corrected so now my account has been merged! (Michelle I hope I remember the right name, thank you!!!) I appreciated her patience with me. End I'm using the app to check in and it was quick and easy. Pleasant experience in mobile check in for me. It is the first time I've done this. Takes the stress off in trying to keep up with a paper boarding pass.",
        "By far the worst airline app. Does not notify you of any changes in flights or gates so completely up to you to constantly check for any updates. My take on Southwest is that it is horrible for the everyday traveler. If you're a once in a blue moon traveler and just need a cheap ticket with free bag then this is the best option for you. If not, then paying $50 extra for another airline that offers a smooth process and peace of mind is much more worth it. Apps only value is mobile boarding pass.",
        "I rarely bother with single-brand travel apps, but this one's an exception. Southwest's app does \"what it says on the tin\"—you can book flights on Southwest from anywhere your phone has signal. Well-designed user interface makes it almost too easy. Good job to the dev team on this one!"

Every tracker that is found will be saved locally on your device. \nWhenever a tracker gets detected multiple times the app will recognize this. It compares the locations where the tracker has been detected. \nIf a tracker is detected at least 3 times and the locations have changed (to make sure its not your neighbour) the app sends you a notification. \nIf this tracker is an AirTag you can play a sound to find it. \n\nAll this happens locally on your device and the private information, like location, tracker ids, etc will never leave your device. \n\nWho are we?\nWe are part of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.

      "comments": [
        "Updated to 5 stars. This has detected a few different scenarios that were done on purpose (car, bag, pet tag). It takes a little while, but it does need to determine patterns. It was able to find and detect more than just apple which was nice to see. Thanks all for the work. Hopefully this will make it into android OS by default. --------- Installed finally after waiting a long while. I'll update again if it ever notifies me of the tag that I put in my car that's tied to a buddies iPhone.",
        "Hi, this app was working. Until the Jan 3 22 update. I am looking at aApple device, that this app \"hit\" before the update. Many times, many days. I'm aware of a follower. Now I even run manual scan, and the app found it, on the screen only, but did not log the hit. Did not even put it on the ignore list. I can see the Apple device, with my own eyes, and it's powered up. Now what?",
        "I like the concept! I installed the app and dug through the source code. The biggest weakness of this app is the location data quality is poor. It looks like location comes from the GPS or network, whatever is fastest, but not whichever is most accurate. Bluetooth tracking is in the range of tens of meters which needs high accuracy to work, so the idea doesn't work, unless you get lucky and get good location data.",
        "So far it's detected a airtag on my vehicle, which I am taking to someone to search for. I wish it wouldn't pick up apple tablets, phones and such. But I would really like if we could get more explaination on what the tracker means, how long it's been tracking like to which locations, and gave me better details on the map. Also when I was hitting the button to make the airtag make a sound it wasn't working. Please keep working on this app to improve, we need this safe technology.",
        "The app is insightful & useful. But I have to uninstall app until developers make changes. It needs option to turn off scanning when desired. Add a button for \"on/off\" or an option to \"diasable automatic scanning\". It was of interest seeing an apple device follow me & child to several stores & within a store. I am skilled at pattern recognition & was uncomfortable with all that I learned from the scanning data. I wont mention it so not to teach the wrong people how the app should not be used."

        "I dont know what I was expecting from the \"full version\" to pay $4.99 There's only 10 areas with a limited amount of levels. After that, that's basically it. The story doesnt go on. You cannot upgrade anything else after a little while. Anyone who wants the \"full version\" dont waste your money. The game is basically the demo with only 9 more areas to unlock lol",
        "Very fun! I played this a lot on the computer when I was younger, and I'm glad to see it translated to well to mobile! One critique: on the computer version you could right-click the mouse to cancel all queued actions. Does the mobile version have that feature? If not, I'd love to see it added!",
        "Not the most fun game, id have given it a 2 at first with all the repetition but as soon as I was aiming for perfect scores on each level it got a little better, not great but makes you think a little more and strategies that much more instead of playing easily on auto pilot almost falling asleep. Seems like an easy one for 100% on achievements and they actually work unlike ALOT of bigger dev games.",
        "I do love the game so I paid for the full game.. very disappointed to say this only took a day or 2 to complete and I only played an hour or 2 each day.. i know free games with many many more levels to keep you entertained so expected a lot when I've paid for the privilege of playing.. the game itself is great and I love it but just so disappointed with the number of levels. And yes before anyone thinks it.. I've completed each level to the max scores and trophies etc.",
        "Loved this game for a long time. But the new update has made it much more difficult. I miss the face mask that was custom to the customer and they told you exactly which bath bomb they wanted. All of this pressing arrows to select the mask and brows is very meticulous and takes way too much time. I miss the old features!"

        "You're supposed to be able to adjust the amps that the Chargepoint Home Flex charger outputs, but I can no longer find that setting in the app. I've called Support twice, and they have been useless. They supposedly escalated the issue to a supervisor, but I've not received the return call that they promised. If you'd like to be able to adjust your charging amps, perhaps in order to better match charging to your solar output, then I'd suggest buying a different product.",
        "I really like this app, because it's easy to use and has plenty of functionality. Great to be able to follow/manage charging remotely, track your charging history, and search for/view charge station information (cost, availability, and usage trends). I give 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes location info for a station is incorrect or inadequate (not specifying where it is within a parking garage, for example), and the ability to troubleshoot a malfunctioning station is very limited.",
        "I am pleased with this app so far, and it's nice to know that ChargePoint has a fairly nice network of chargers in the San Antonio area and places I travel. This app seems well-designed, but others point out that the app automatically refills the balance monthly without notice. I haven't experienced that yet, but I would be concerned if that did happen. Currently, Android Auto causes my phone to heat up while drivingmy Mustang Mach-E, but I haven't narrowed it down to this app yet.",
        "The payment options are terrible. You automatically reload $10 when your balance drops below $5 for the first month, then it will automatically reload your average monthly cost, which for me was $60. No email or notification that $60 would be added, just took it straight from my account. There is no way to manually load your balance or to change how much is added, it is all automatic. This system of payment is not user friendly and needs an update. Would be 5 stars if not for this major problem",
        "Very nicely designed app for EV charging. The map functionality (uses Google Maps) is responsive and accurate. I'm extremely impressed at how well it works with the Charge Point Home Flex charger - the process of connecting to my phone and WiFi network was quick and flawless. My 50A outlet was ready; it took less than 20 minutes for unboxing, mounting, setting up with the app, and charging for the first time."

        "Great app. But there is one problem I can't seem to fix. Even when I have supervised mode on it plays clean songs even though I didn't add the clean versions of whatever song to my playlist. I deleted my playlist and got a new one with the same songs and no clean versions. However, it started playing clean versions for no reason. I don't know if this happens to everyone, but it does get really annoying when the song skips through the curse words.",
        "Anyone with a fancy audio system should stay away from this service. Not being an audiophile, I honestly wasn't expecting to be able to tell the difference between this app's highest quality audio and lossless audio from a competing service in my car's premium audio system. But I did and YouTube Music's audio quality was downright atrocious. It almost felt like listening to an 8-bit recording, particularly with higher frequencies. At least the interface and music selection seemed competitive.",
        "For those who have a large personal music library who wishes to listen to them, this app is worse than Microsoft's Media Player and the freeware version will constantly suggest signing up for their premium service. This app does not work for music library management. Metadata cannot be edited, and thus clean-up/corrections are impossible. Most of the metadata sorting features found in other music library apps are also missing. Thus, playing all songs of a certain genre is impossible without creating a playlist, which is time consuming without the typical methods of grouping songs\\albums. And, there is no bulk selection features. Thus, if you wish to remove songs, they have to be removed one at a time, or by deleting one album at a time. Essentially, the app wants you to pay to listen to their song library, and listen based on their recommendations. What happened to \"don't be evil?\"",
        "I love this app and, because of the music locker feature, it is, by far, the best music streaming app available. The interface is intuitive, they have the rarest of rare songs, remixes and bootlegs and a library like none other. I also love how it works with Android Auto and on my smart devices. To request a song/album/artist by voice is a really cool feature. It doesn't have hi-fi streaming yet, but my untrained ear can't tell the difference. Hoping they'll add podcasts soon, but couldn't be happier with the features and the quality of the app.",
        "It's pretty good music service. One of the few that lets you upload your own stuff and access it remotely. That said, I don't know why their shuffle feature is so weird. Shuffle is heavily influenced by algorithms and never just gives you random tracks. And if you use shuffle a lot it predicts you want to hear the same stuff over and over again that the shuffle was already playing. Here's to hoping that true randomized shuffling comes back someday."

        "I saw this app & decided to try it. With other games, I immediately find numerous significant discrepancies: the avatars are nothing like the description/ad, nor is the game so I uninstall immediately. However, I've been playing from the start (like a drug addict) 🤣 - can't get enough! The avatars are beautiful, makeup, hair & clothes r fab & trendy, & just my style! I want them for real! Of course the fact that I've only lost 1 game out of approx 60+/- doesn't hurt! Your team is brilliant ty❤",
        "For being a core android app, this app is complete garbage! I get network issues all the time, not because of my network that works for everything else, JUST this app. Some downloads freeze halfway, no matter how many times I restart, and other times I get a image of a sad satellite saying Try Again. I also have \"auto update\" turned on but every time I check there's like 20+ apps waiting to update. It's also just a bad, confusing interface. Come on Google, get your act together!!!",
        "Oh my goodness, no words can describe how awesome and incredible this game is. First off, the detail on this game is beyond good, also the story line is so suspenseful and crazy good. The only issues about this game is probably the lack of ads. I just recommend the developers, or the people that made this game could please shorten the ads, cause it does get annoying, but other than that, it's amazing. Also, the fact that it's free is shocking to me, the point is I highly recommend this game! :)",
        "Best Ever!!! Only thing I would change are the prices. Some games are great in the paid section, but most are either a waste of time or just glitch ridden and full of ads. Nobody wants to stop playing every 30 seconds to watch an ad for another game thats filled with issues as well! Other than that Google is the best place to find what u need and the correct information. Thanks google",
        "I'm writing this review hoping to get your attention. This app is one of the core Android apps. It's very useful for saving my game progress and allowing me access to certain features on games this is exactly why I believe you should pay more attention to it. The app is very buggy(if that makes sense). I can't even get past the loading screen to use it and others have mentioned that other problems such as it randomly closing. I'd appreciate it if you could check on the app and work on this."

        "There aren't many tools that can beat Notion in terms of versatility and use for project management, but if you're looking for a more straightforward note-taking app, there are better alternatives out there. App performance has drastically improved since it was first released, but still a long way to go before it feels smooth on mobile. Biggest downside is the fact that everything is stored on the cloud and there isn't a true offline mode where your actual files are saved locally.",
        "Really slow, almost unusable. I can't type fsster than 20 wpm, delete more than 10 words at a time, or change a few settings without the app crashing. The delay on typing can be almost 5 second longs (let that sink in; a delay of half a second is annoying). There's no offline mode, even though I don't use any online features. I checked and re-checked; no magic setting that fixes it. I'd give it 5 stars, if only it worked.",
        "Edit: Tried Notion again, it's much better and usable now, but still noticeably slow compared to other apps. Cool features but painfully slow. It's the slowest when typing. If I a type a sentence or 2, it can easily get behind by a few words. When typing, it takes a second for the letter to actually appear on screen. The issue does not go way despite clearing cache and storage. I want to like this app, but it's pretty much unusable like this.",
        "I think they need to stop with the new features and focus on making this app leaner. I'm counting close to 7 to 11 seconds before everything loads for a database. I'm just getting sick how sluggish this app feels. There have been some improvements in speed but it's still not enough. There are times where I just don't even bother using Notion because of the slow performance. And it's definitely not my phone! OneNote and Google keep load and 3 to 5 seconds tops!",
        "I use the desktop version, which works great, but the android app seems really buggy. I start typing then the cursor jumps to random places on the page after a couple minutes of use. I'm afraid that I'll lose data or something if this keeps up. Please fix it so that I can also take notes on my phone without having to worry that I'll lose data!"

        "No longer works. It used to work fine to change the active noise level but after the 3/31/22 update it no longer sees my headset even though it works fine with my phone. I just want to change the level of noise reduction when using it for phone calls. It used to work fine. I've tried all the troubleshooting tips in the app and on the website. Seems like this should be the easiest part of designing a $350 headset",
        "I use the Bose Connect App for my Bose Sport Earbuds. When I attempted to connect to them this evening, they weren't able to be seen by the app. I tried un-pairing and re-pairing. That didn't work. I noticed that the Bose Connect app (Google App) had been updated recently, so I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app so it would be a fresh copy of the most recent app. That definitely solved the issue. 👍",
        "Worthless, invasive. Refuses to recognize my QuietComfort 35 II even though they're connected to the phone (and only the phone) and playing music just fine // EDIT connected after uninstalling and reinstalling // Most egregiously, it forces you to agree to sharing your location in order to use the app. and automatically opts you in to other data collection. Unbelievable. Will never buy another Bose product while these anti-consumer policies remain; a shame because the hardware is great.",
        "Party mode is very buggy, it takes about 5 to 10 tries to connect 2 speakers, every single time. The app for some reason requires location access, but says it's only needed for the find my headphones feature. Makes no sense. I like Bose products but this is getting annoying, I can't ever have a peaceful listening experience anymore with Bose products, it's always a hassle now. I don't want to switch to JBL or another speaker brand, but it's getting to that point. I wish they could resolve this",
        "I will not be purchasing Bose going forward. it's unfortunate that they decided to go this route of inconveniencing their customers and demanding they install an app and share their location just to use a speaker. The fact that you even have to install an app to connect the Bluetooth is ridiculous. My phone connects to other Bluetooth devices without having to install an app."

        "Could not be worse. Don't get me wrong, the shows are great, but it doesn't matter if you only ever get an infinite loading screen and never reach login. When it used to work, it suffered from major buffer issues. Until they fix this app, there is no point in downloading it. Not to mention, it uses a lot of trackers like Braze to grab your personal data. Examples include GPS coordinates, last name, email address, and device model. If you've access to an alternative, I highly recommend using it.",
        "i have no idea why, but any time i try to watch something on my phone, i just get a black screen. i can hear perfectly fine, the audio is crystal clear, but the screen remains blank throughout the entire duration of my selected video. i've restarted my phone, undownloaded and re-download the app many times, nothing seems to help. this is super unfortunate as disney is usually my first choice streaming platform. would really love this problem fixed.",
        "Great app with amazing original content, when it decides to work right. 4 different devices tried, none work. Edit: It has been years now and it still will not work on any mobile devices regardless of permissions granted or even when anything is downloaded. Playback is just a black screen or a neverending loading symbol. The price is too high for the quality of technical support from Disney.",
        "Great app. However, Disney, you need to create a screen between your home screen and playing a movie. Like a title screen asking if you want to resume the movie or restart from the beginning. It becomes incredibly frustrating rewinding a movie, especially on the TV. Every other streaming service has the title screen I'm talking about. In case you need examples 🙄",
        "The Disney+ app is by far the worst streaming app I've used. Downloads work maybe 10% of the time. Either the download gets stuck and all future downloads fail unless you uninstall the app and reinstall, or after downloading, the video refuses to playback. When you're out on a road trip with screaming kids, this app is not your friend. Stick with Netflix."

        "I enjoy this game. Great time waster but two problems. 1: Everytime I collect resources and after I use them to unlock a new part of the map an ad pops up (every time). 2: Everytime I close the app to take a break and try to log back in it gets to the loading screen and closes on me. It takes me 5+ tries just to try and get into the game without it closing on me.",
        "Despite using a Google account to sign in, the game reset itself somehow. My character has all the armor upgrades but the entire world reset to the couple tiles. Disappointing. It was a fun game. (And I paid money to get rid of ads). I'll keep it for a little while to see if it is a bug that'll reset back to normal. But will definitely be deleting if it doesn't resolve itself. The game itself was fun.",
        "Enjoyed the game so much I completed it. Well I got as far as there was to go.. But it was awhile ago when there wasn't a way to sign in with Google. Got a new phone and lost my game in the process. Those that are upset about the ads... Using the ads to your benefit to get those lump sum of certain items you need will definitely benefit you in the end.Upgrading all 3 weapons at least 10 times each is the only way to move forward. So use those ads or chop,chop,chop for much longer of a time.",
        "I have played a lot of mobile games but this one, by far, has the most ad interruptions that most cannot be skipped. I didn't trust some of the other reviews but now I'm a believer. The ads constantly interrupting the game makes it unplayable. Somewhat fun between the ads so 2 stars. I do recommend the developers to rename the game \"My Ad Universe\"",
        "I like this game overall... but there is no point to it. Just collect resources. Unlock areas on the map. Upgrade your equipment. Repeat. Repeat. It becomes very tedious once you get to the end of the second planet. If I get to the third planet and there are no automated resource collection options... I'll probably loose interest really fast."

        "Vuzix had fixed the notification syncing issues that I had in the past. Using my Vuzix Blade, enabling Google Maps on their notifications and showing the directions on the Blade makes navigation a much safer driving experience. I wish there are more 3rd party apps for it. I recommend restarting the phone if the Vuzix Blade is disconnected from the phone.",
        "App support non existant expensive for non working apps. Discord is there cool cant login because google isnt supported. Okay let's try any other app. Not google earth same issue and google translate wont let me scroll down to set it up. Also theres no scroll down so sometimes you get apps that are built for this screen but you cant select or scroll to select anything in them. Oh I guess all I can really do is read my text which my watch does better and watch netflix or amazon prime with one eye.",
        "We have a beta pair currently developing our app! We did get to download the app and run a few tests. So far no apps pop up in the store on search and notifications aren't working. **just noticed an update, so maybe a fix?**",
        "I'm pissed i bought such a expensive glasses that i can only take photos and record and the quality is horrible. Vuzix jumped out there to beat odg r8 and r9 the battery also suck it only has potential. I mean it doesn't have at least 3 good apps out the box it does none of what was advertised",
        "Not sure what was done in the latest update but it works much better with Vuzix Blade. Notifications are showing up properly and the app is not freezing up! Android 10 OnePlus 7 Pro"

        "This app takes longer than setting a static IP on a laptop and directly connecting it to the device that needs to be configured. It found my device twice, but couldn't do anything with it. Most of the time it doesn't find it at all. The app gives a list of devices to search but the list doesn't do anything, so manually selecting the device does nothing. Not sure what this app is actually for other than wasting time.",
        "I wish this app was advanced as UniFi. Right now I have to bounce back and fourth between both apps because I use a EdgeRouter 4 with a EdgeSwitch 8 and run 2 AP Pros and the APs have to be on the UniFi to control unless I'm missing something. But that being said..... the UniFi experience is leaps and bounds over the the UNMS experience. UNMS is still a great way to customize most controls. The only thing I am not able to do is port management on my switch. All in all, great app.",
        "App update deleted all my backups and no longer shows Lan connection speed, which is useful for trouble shooting radios. Also removed frequency scan list, so now you're forced to scan all frequencies when looking for an access point. You can no longer manually change the output power, it's either auto or max.",
        "After realizing how much the app leaves inaccessible in contrast to the web ui, it gets a 1 Star. I've said it before, I'm saying it now and I'll say it again; the app should be able to do EVERYTHING that the web ui can do PERIOD... It was a confusing mess but I finally got my PtP bridge setup. I'm not entirely sure how, as the app didn't really make things easy, but it also could have been much worse.",
        "Nothing works, errors anytime it tries to connect. Setting up aircube leaves the app frozen and must force quit. Keeps telling me I need to connect to my UISP, which is already connected."

        "I love snapchat, I've had it and loved it for years. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've been having issues with the filters working, and when looking through saved memories, I hit save one time and there are multiples of many, copies of my videos are shorter, some are split up into 2 or 3 videos. The split videos when I select one video to delete (bc it's a multiple) it selects both/all that would have made the original video. One one video, the text I had made small is big.",
        "App is quite confusing. I expected it to be much more user friendly & to be easily navigated through. I can never seem to get to the option I want to. There is no real option to get help or assistance. Once I get to another screen it never lets me go back. I don't like the constant change of filters many being unattractive especially when I've seen great ones. When I opened my account I was unaware I could never change my username. I couldn't think of what I wanted at the moment.",
        "I don't know what happened in the last update, but taking snaps now all of a sudden will either shift the text over to outside the screen area, so no one can read the text. Not only this, but the cameras will occasionally zoom in all the way and I'll have to reset the app to fix it. Another thing I just experienced was the camera was completely distorted as if there was a drunk filter over it. You guys messed up this update, because it was perfect before.",
        "For the past week I have not been able to record snaps, it stops as soon as I hold the button down. I also cannot send audio clips. For about two days I was unable to send bitmojis as well. I've tried to report the problem within the app but have not gotten any response back or even acknowledgement the report was received. I've tried turning my phone off and back on and even uninstalling and reinstalling the app, without luck.",
        "This app has really evolved over the years and still kept its base purpose. This is my go-to social app with friends. It's very convenient to share pictures. Some complaints: I don't like the new feature to drag text down to delete the whole thing. I often delete mine unintentionally while positioning it. I think this needs to be reworked but has a good intention. Dark mode has now been a standard for years yet it is not available for this app. I don't understand what's taking so long."

        "love this app, makes working with the bmpcc 4k on your own incredibly intuitive and easy! I did run into one particular use case that i don't see any settings for in the app, and uncertain if they can be implemented: Realized after racking up the camera and getting ready to record that i did not have the proper audio inputs selected for recording. there are no settings to set this in the app! i'll have to unrack and use the built in monitor to change and re set up the camera. Other than that, great stuff, and works flawlessly. I wonder if that setting can be implemented in the future? thanks for this app!",
        "Nice app, but the length of the focus slider is far too short to reliably achieve accurate focus. Even on a 10\" tablet with the slider scale set to 2x. I *strongly* and respectfully suggest the addition of a mode in which the zoom and focus sliders occupy the entire height of the screen. In all other respects, this is the best app I've tried for the BMPCC 4k (and I believe I have them all). But the inexplicable decision to limit the size of the focus slider makes every app virtually useless for my work. Increase the size of the focus slider to the maximum height allowed by any particular device, and it's five stars all the way.",
        "Really great app! Needs an update to have all of the correct labels for the Blackmagic 6K, but I love the functionality!! You can change any setting and even run/stop the camera from your phone! That feature alone is one I've wanted for a long time. This will be great for my focus pullers to use so I don't have to worry about certain settings when operating the camera! The layout is nice and simple. It also connects in seconds which is invaluable. Very well done app.",
        "Amazing app. Controls so much on the bmpcc. Still no ef focus or zoom and based on the last update date this is probably an abandoned app which is unfortunate. It does work very well. It connects right away and doesnt need to be paired once you first pair. Much easier than contorting to use the on-cam screen. Love it! (Not sure why I have a 2nd review. App still doesnt recognize my 6k as a 6k so that's weird. Knocking a couple stars for that and the abandonment issue.)",
        "Really like this App. I wish it had more rack focus points to set. That would be huge. I use this App together with my Edelkrone HeadPlus and slider which is also controlled by Bluetooth. Something that Edelkrone does well is let you set points and then take a photo to have a visual representation of what the next point jumps to. This could be a UI enhancement. In a perfect world I could use this App to control the BMPC4K focus and the Edelkrone movements at the same time. One can dream :)"

        "I've been using Gboard for almost as long as I've used Android devices. I never had a problem up until now. All of a sudden in the last week or so, the cursor will jump to random places in whatever I'm typing, throw predictive text wherever the cursor lands, backspace in the middle of words, etc. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the keyboard, but it worked even worse somehow. If I could give 0/5, I would. It's pretty unusable. Stuck defaulting to the Samsung keyboard.",
        "I can't back up and correct anything. The curser jumps to the end of the sentence when trying to backspace or insert text. When it does go to the end of the sentence and I to click on backspace, it doubles the letters in the word the cursor is next to. I can no longer highlight a word and click on the capitalize/shift option. Please fix. Until such time, I'll have to go back to the stock keyboard. This is NOT a phone issue. It's happening with so many others' regardless of point manufacturer.",
        "*EDIT* *The issue was apparently on Facebook. Changed to 5 star.* I've been using GBoard for years. There now seems to be an insurmountable issue causing it to be completely unusable. Cursor goes wherever it wants while you're trying to type. Cannot edit any text from previous words as it will force the cursor all the way to the end of the sentence as soon as you type or delete. It adds letters while you're trying to delete words at the end after.",
        "After recent updates, it is now almost impossible to edit text that is in the middle without the cursor jumping to where you are not typing. It is very frustrating to backspace all the way back to the spot that needs edited instead of just being able to touch the word and edit it. Whatever was changed on this update needs to be reversed as it is badly flawed.",
        "A glitch! The keyboard is mostly useless because when I try to correct something,the cursor will jump to a random place and add a few letters at random. The only way I can correct this is to start over by deleting my text and slowly type with one finger. I see others have this problem. Plus, I notice the clipboard is gone. Ugh..."

        "when the app works it's great, however when launched and the \"scan the area around you\" prompt will not go away. I'm tried pressing all over the screen, changing light settings etc and it stays on. On occasion it'll go away and then i can use the app as intended. Please add an \"ok\" button or just remove the prompt after the first time opening it. Otherwise it's useless since it cannot be used. If there's a way to remove the prompt please let me know.",
        "To the programers:definitely has some kinks & bugs that need to be worked out. When app works, I've only been successful once & w/ nothing I was actually trying to measure, is pretty cool but 1/5 times is horrible odds. Note10+ when app is launched all it does is displays a tutorial which indicates (demonstrates what the user should do to obtain a measurement) to scan area but nothing more. The app also just closes out. If it worked it wld be a handy app especially when eyeballing wont cut it",
        "Works way better that I was expecting. Measured my 15.6\" laptop screen from 4 feet away as being 15.5\". Results definitely very on the surface being measured however that more of a issue with TOF not the app. Make sure your are in a well lit area and avoid black of reflective surfaces like the app tells you and you shouldn't have any issues.",
        "Not an app one would imagine is very useful but when you're trying to measure for new furniture it's perfect! Some are worried about access to camera and photo gallery. If it doesn't have access to this it can't use the camera to measure and it can't take an image of the measurement. Some people are so dumb. lol",
        "Abysmal. Don't even try to use this, it just ends in frustration. It's like Samsung took all the worst ways to approximate distance and combined them into one sub quality app. Expect to constantly see the words \"couldn't detect distance\" regardless of your environment."
